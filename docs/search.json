    "text": "First login\nYou’ll get into RStudio via the url https://rstudio.macalester.edu. It’s linked in our Moodle page if you’re feeling a little lazy. Your login is your Macalester username and password. You’ll be given the following page (with your username in the uppper right corner):\n\nI tend to ignore the projects and just activate a new session by clicking that panel.\n\n\nThe RStudio window\nOnce you’ve got an active session, you’ll be shown the following window. We’ll talk about its parts, starting with the four panels you’ll see. This picture is from a previous version of RStudio, but everything should work the same!\n\n\nPanels\n\nSource: This is where you will edit RMarkdown notebooks, which are described much more in the RMarkdown section.\nConsole: This is RStudio’s command line. It’s a great place to test code and serves as a basic calculator.\nEnvironment, history: this panel keeps track of your work. The environment tab shows all the variables you have named in the session (including data, functions, and lists) and gives you a preview of them. The history tab tracks the pieces of code you run.\nEverything else: this is where you’ll find a lot of stuff, including the files you build and the plots you create of data/functions. It also has the packages list (described in the next subsection) and the help window, which can show you documentation of commands.\n\nNow that we know what we’re looking at, let’s talk specifics. We’ll talk a lot more about the source panel in the RMarkdown section.\n\n\nSpecific functions\n\nThe new document button. This is how you’ll make new files in your source window.\nThe quit session button. Somtimes it’s best to just start over if you can’t figure out why something it not working. You’ll be kicked back to that first page from the previous section.\nThe clean environment button. Use this when you want to clear all you variables, including data sets.\nThe files buttons. You’ll use these to create, delete, and organize RMarkdown files and data files. See the data section for more information on how to upload data.\n\n\n\nCommand Line Console\nThe command line console is the most basic way to run code. It’s great for simple calculations and to test out code before you run it. We’ll run longer blocks of code in our notebooks. You can try out a few calculations here.\nNotice! Once you run a command (by pressing enter) it is gone to history. You don’t go back and edit previous lines if you find a mistake. Instead, you run the command again with the fixed piece in a new line. Thankfully, RStudio makes this not so terrible. By pushing the UP button on your keyboard, you can scroll through previous commands that you’ve used.\n\n\n\nPackages\nRStudio is open source, which means many people write packages to augment what it can do by default. Their work is our gain, and we’ll need a few packages to be able to access what we want. In the lower right hand panel click on the packages tab. Then click on the check boxes next to the following packages:\n\n\nmosaic, mosaicCore, mosaicData: these contain the specific built-ins which create and plot functions for us. By checking the box by them, we import their functions into the session. Easy enough.\nmosaicCalc: Some of the function commands from the mosaic family of packages don’t interact well with the built in derivative and antiderivative functions in RStudio. mosaicCalc fixes this\n\nIf you don’t see mosaicCalc, then you need to download it. Run the following line of code in your console: install.packages(\"mosaicCalc\") Once you do this, make sure that the mosaicCal box is checked in the packages list\n\ntinytex: this package allows you to create PDF documents from your RMarkdown files. To make sure that tinytex in installed, run the following line of code in your console: tinytex::install_tinytex() ## RMarkdown\n\nIn AMC1, we’ll be working with code a lot: writing it, running it, analyzing it, and commenting on it. We’ll also be going back to code we’ve already used and tweaking it to solve new but related questions. For all of these reasons, we’re going to use RMarkdown notebooks. The notebook will run large chunks of code at a time and show the output right next to the code. It’s also easier for you to comment on the code you’ve written and go back to it later.\nThe best way to get working on this is to upload the template that I’ve put in the course Moodle page and just start experimenting with what’s there. I’m sure you’ll get it sorted!",

    "text": "Troubleshooting\nWithout fail, you will run into problems. Sometimes RStudio will give you helpful error messages, but sometimes they are obtuse. Here’s a list of some common errors and what might be wrong:\n\nNothing ran, all I got was a plus sign… You probably forgot some parentheses. Try the following:\n\nEnter a parenthesis on that line to see if this closes it out.\nPress the Escape key to get to a new line.\n\nUnexpected symbol in… You may have forgotten a multiplication sign or otherwise gave RStudio a symbol it cannot parse. Check your line of code again to see if you have all your symbols.\nObject not found… You may not have defined that variable (or function) yet. Check your environment tab to see if it has the object you’re looking for (or if you’ve called it something different than you remember!). You also may be trying to use something from a data set that you have not included as a parameter. See if you need to add in the parameter data=....\nCould not find function… RStudio doesn’t know what function you’re using. Check your capitalization and that you have the right packages installed.\n… number of items to replace is not a multiple of replacement length … Your input variable doesn’t match the name variable you used in the output when you called makeFun. Maybe you used x on one side of the tilde ~ and t on the other side?\nArgument “name” is missing, with no default… You’re probably trying to use makeFun without loading the mosaic package, or to plot a vector field without the mosaicCalc package. See the “Loading Mosaic, MosaicCore and MosaicCalc Packages” section at the top of this page for how to fix this.\nI can’t find my data! You may have fetched it but did not give it a name.

So your command must start with f = ... so that you get a function named f.\nThe variable (x or t, etc) that appears in the OUTPUT must match the INPUT variable that appears after the tilde ~. The the command makeFun(x^2 ~ t) won’t work because the x^2 is not a function of t.\n\n\n\nCreating Lists of Data\nUse c() to “combine” some values into a list. Assign the list to a variable so that you can use it later.\n\nmy_primes = c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29)\nmy_primes\n\n [1]  2  3  5  7 11 13 17 19 23 29\n\nmy_data = c(5, -2, 7, 3, -10, 15)\nmy_data\n\n[1]   5  -2   7   3 -10  15\n\n\nUse seq() to generate a sequential list of values in a specified range. The optional third parameter tells RStudio to increment by that value instead of incrementing by 1.\n\nmy_seq1 = seq(1,10)\nmy_seq1\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\nmy_seq2 = seq(5, 6, 0.25)\nmy_seq2\n\n[1] 5.00 5.25 5.50 5.75 6.00\n\nmy_seq3 = seq(5, 6, 0.1)\nmy_seq3\n\n [1] 5.0 5.1 5.2 5.3 5.4 5.5 5.6 5.7 5.8 5.9 6.0\n\n\n\n\nPlotting Data\nUse gf_point to plot a list of \\(y\\)-axis data versus a list of \\(x\\)-axis data. Separate these lists with a tilde ~.\n\nX = seq(1:5)\nY = X^2\ngf_point(Y ~ X)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prefix gf in the name gf_point is short for “graph formula.” You can specify labels for the horizontal axis and the vertical axis using xlab and ylab.\n\nx_data = c(2,3,5,8,13)\ny_data = c(2,4,8,4,2)\ngf_point(y_data ~ x_data, xlab='day', ylab='rainfall (mm)')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting Functions\nUse slice_plot to plot a function.\n\nAs with gf_point, we use a tilde ~ to separate the output variable (the function) from the input variable.\nThe required domain argument specifies the domain for the plot.\n\n\nslice_plot(sin(x) ~ x, domain(x=0:2*pi), color='blue')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add a label to the plot, or to the axes. You do this by\n\nslice_plot(sin(x) ~ x, domain(x=0:2*pi), color='blue') + \n  ylab('sin(x)') + xlab('x values') + labs(title=\"y=sin(x)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can layer one plot on top of another by using a pipe %&gt;%.\n\nYou only need to specify the domain for the first plot because the second one is added to the first.\nIt’s helpful to change the color for subsequent plots. Use the argument color=\"red\" using any color name you like (RStudio knows a lot of colors!)\n\n\nslice_plot(2 * sin(x) ~ x, domain(x=0:2*pi)) %&gt;%\nslice_plot(cos(3*x) ~ x, color='green')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe %&gt;% symbol is pronounced “pipe.” The pipe must appear at the end of the line (not at the start of the next line).\nA command involving a pipe is called a “pipeline.” Think of the calculation as flowing from one command to the next, left to right.\nIf you have specified the domain() at an early stage in the pipeline, you don’t need to specify it again in the later plotting commands. But, if you want, feel free to set the domain explicitly. This is helpful if you want the graphics domain to be different for the different layers.\nPro Tip: write a pipeline with one line for each stage, with the pipe symbol at the end of each stage.\n\nThe slice_plot command takes a whole variety of parameters, here are a few useful ones:\n\ndomain: sets the range of your \\(x\\)-axis. Example: domain(x=1:4).\ncolor: sets the color of the function you plot. RStudio will recognize most basic colors, which you will pass as strings. Example: color=\"red\".\n\nLet’s try some of this out. I broke the third line so it would all fit, you don’t need to!\n\nf=makeFun(x^3+3~x)\ng=makeFun(3*x^2~x)\nslice_plot(f(x)~x, domain(x=1:4), color=\"blue\") %&gt;%\nslice_plot(g(x)~x, col=\"red\") + xlab(\"time\")  + ylab(\"red=velocity, blue=position\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRStudio is a little weird about plots in the RMarkdown in that you might get multiples if you’re adding plots together. If you want the chunk to hold all plots until the end, add fig.show='hold' into the script braces at the top of the chunk.\n\n\nPlotting Data and Functions\nWe can also combine plots of data and functions using the pipe comment &gt;%&gt;.\n\ntime_data = seq(0,50, 10)\npop_data = c(6.82, 9.63, 14.3, 20.48, 28.94, 42.25)\n\nP = makeFun( 6.82 * (1.037)^t ~ t)\n\ngf_point(pop_data ~ time_data, xlab='years since 1950', ylab='population (millions)') %&gt;%\nslice_plot(P(t) ~ t, domain(t=0:50), color='orange')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotting Surfaces in 3D\nWe plot functions \\(z = f(x,y)\\) using the contour_plot command. We specify the independent variables with the syntax ~ x&y.\n\nf = makeFun(x^2 - y^2 ~ x&y)\n\ncontour_plot(f(x,y) ~ x&y, domain(x=-2:2, y=-2:2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, RStudio labels every other countour. We can change this using the skip parameter. The default value of skip is 1. If we want to label every contour, we set skip=0.\n\nf = makeFun(x^2 - y^2 ~ x&y)\n\ncontour_plot(f(x,y) ~ x&y, domain(x=-2:2, y=-2:2), skip=0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add more contours using the contours_at parameter, and turn off the shading with the filled parameter.\n\ncontour_plot(f(x,y) ~ x&y, domain(x=-2:2, y=-2:2), contours_at = seq(-3 ,3, .5))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can change the plot range using domain.\n\ncontour_plot(f(x,y) ~ x&y, domain(x=-20:20, y=-20:20))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can create a 3D plot interactive_plot.\n\ninteractive_plot(f(x,y) ~ x&y, domain(x=-20:20, y=-20:20))\n\nLoading required namespace: plotly",

    "text": "Differentiation\n\nEstimating the Derivative\nWe can estimate the derivative of \\(f'(x)\\) by using the average rate of change \\[\nf'(x) \\approx\\frac{f(x+\\alpha)-f(x)}{\\alpha}\n\\] for some small number \\(\\alpha &gt; 0\\). Smaller and smaller \\(\\alpha\\)’s lead to better and better approximations.\nSo we can estimate the derivative by using smaller and smaller \\(\\alpha\\) values until our estimates stabilize. Here is an example that estimates \\(f'(4)\\) for the function \\(f(x) = x^2 + 10*\\sin(x)\\).\n\nf=makeFun(x^2+10*sin(x)~x)\nalpha=c(1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001, 0.000001, 0.0000001)\nd=(f(4+alpha)-f(4))/alpha\nd\n\n[1] 6.978782 1.952538 1.511513 1.468349 1.464042 1.463612 1.463569 1.463564\n\n\nThe estimates stabilize to the value \\(1.46356\\). So our estimate is \\(f'(4) \\approx 1.46456\\)\n\n\nEstimating the Partial Derivative\nWe can use the same method to estimate the partial derivates of \\(g(x,y)\\). We have \\[\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} \\approx\\frac{g(x+\\alpha,y)-f(x,y)}{\\alpha}\n\\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad\n\\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\approx\\frac{g(x,y+\\alpha)-f(x,y)}{\\alpha}\n\\] Let’s estimate the partial derivatives of \\(g(x,y) = e^{x \\sin(y)}\\) at the point \\((2, 7)\\). First, let’s estimate \\(g_x(2,7) = \\left. \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial x} \\right|_{(2,7)}\\). The code is very similar to the code we used for a single variable function.\n\ng=makeFun(exp(x*sin(y))~x&y)\nalpha=c(1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001, 0.000001, 0.0000001)\nd=(g(2+alpha,7)-g(2,7))/alpha\nd\n\n[1] 3.456634 2.526691 2.452648 2.445403 2.444680 2.444608 2.444601 2.444600\n\n\nWe conclude that \\(g_x(2,7) \\approx 2.445.\\)\nNow let’s estimate \\(g_y(2,7) = \\left. \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial y} \\right|_{(2,7)}\\). All we need to do is move alpha into the \\(y\\)-variable.\n\ng=makeFun(exp(x*sin(y))~x&y)\nalpha=c(1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, 0.00001, 0.000001, 0.0000001)\nd=(g(2,7+alpha)-g(2,7))/alpha\nd\n\n[1] 3.512524 5.761618 5.628032 5.612215 5.610611 5.610450 5.610434 5.610433\n\n\nWe conclude that \\(g_y(2,7) \\approx 5.610.\\)\n\n\nClassifying 2D Critical Points\nOnce you’ve identified a critical point (where both \\(f_x = 0\\) and \\(f_y=0\\)), you need to determine whether it is a local maximum, a local minimum, or a saddle point.\nFor example, here is code to check the critical point \\((2,-1)\\) of the function \\(f(x,y)=x^2 + 2y^4 + 4xy\\). We compare the value of the function at \\((2,-1)\\) with the values of the function at points on a small circle around the critical point.\n\nf = makeFun(x^2 + 2*y^4 + 4*x*y ~ x&y)\na=2\nb=-1\n\nr = 0.1\ntheta = seq(0,2*pi,pi/10)\nf(a,b) - f(a+r*cos(theta), b+r*sin(theta)) \n\n [1] -0.010000000 -0.032025526 -0.065424470 -0.096866673 -0.114533357\n [6] -0.112200000 -0.091021947 -0.058824413 -0.027382209 -0.008514116\n[11] -0.010000000 -0.032497662 -0.068673667 -0.105338809 -0.128297176\n[16] -0.128200000 -0.104785766 -0.067296549 -0.030631406 -0.008986252\n[21] -0.010000000\n\n\nAll of these values are negative, which means that \\((2,-1)\\) is a local minimum.\nIn general: - If all values are positive, then \\((a,b)\\) is a local maximum of \\(f(x,y)\\). - If all values are negative, then \\((a,b)\\) is a local minimum of \\(f(x,y)\\). - If the values are both positive and negative, then \\((a,b)\\) is a saddle point of \\(f(x,y)\\).\n\n\nGradient Search\nHere is code that will use gradient search to find the maximum of the function \\[\nf(x,y) = - x^4 -  x^3 + 10 x y + 2y - 8 y^2\n\\] whose partial derivatives are \\[\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = -4 x^3 -3 x^2  + 10 y\n\\quad \\mbox{and} \\quad\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} = 10 x + 2 - 16 y\n\\]\nFirst, you define the partial derivatives and then choose your starting point (newx, newy). In this case, we start at (1,1).\n\npartialx=makeFun( -4*x^3 -3*x^2 + 10*y~x&y)\npartialy=makeFun(10*x + 2 - 16*y~x&y)\nnewx = 1\nnewy = 1\n\nNext, you repeatedly run the following code block, which updates the current point by moving 0.1 times the gradient vector. This is equivilant to taking a small step in the uphill direction.\nRepeatedly to run this code block until the partial derivatives are essentially zero (at least two zeros after the decimal point). Congrats! You have found your local maximum.\n\nslopex=partialx(newx, newy)\nslopey=partialy(newx, newy)\nnewx = newx + 0.1*slopex\nnewy = newy + 0.1*slopey\n# print new partial derivatives\nc(partialx(newx, newy), partialy(newx, newy))\n# print new point\nc(newx, newy)\n\nRepeatedly running this code block will take you to the point (1.04,0.77). But note that starting at another initial point might take you to a different local maximum.\nIf you want to find a local minimum, then you should multiply the partials by -0.1 instead.

Let’s make another plot to get a better estimate.\n\ncontour_plot(P(x,y)~x&y, domain(x=0:40, y=20:60), \n             contours_at=seq(20,50,2), skip=0) |&gt;\n  contour_plot(Q(x,y) ~ x & y, contour_color=\"black\", \n               contours_at=c(200), label_placement=.25)\n\nScale for colour is already present.\nAdding another scale for colour, which will replace the existing scale.\nScale for fill is already present.\nAdding another scale for fill, which will replace the existing scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn this zoomed in plot, we can refine our estimate a bit. The maximum \\(f(10,53)=38\\) is achieved at \\(x=10\\) and \\(y=53\\).\nNow, if I want to estimate the Lagrange multiplier \\(\\lambda\\), I would change my constraint a little bit (say to \\(210\\)) and then look at the change in the optimal value.\n\ncontour_plot(P(x,y)~x&y, domain(x=0:40, y=20:60), \n             contours_at=seq(20,50,2), skip=0) |&gt;\n  contour_plot(Q(x,y) ~ x & y, contour_color=\"black\", \n               contours_at=c(200,210), skip=0, \n               label_placement=.25)\n\nScale for colour is already present.\nAdding another scale for colour, which will replace the existing scale.\nScale for fill is already present.\nAdding another scale for fill, which will replace the existing scale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have \\[\n\\lambda = \\frac{\\triangle \\mbox{optimal value}}{\\triangle \\mbox{constraint}}\n= \\frac{40 - 38}{210-200} = \\frac{2}{10} = 0.2.\n\\]",

Can you guess the name of the square root function?\n\n\n\nVariables, Lists and Sequences\nWhen we do a calculation, we can store the result for later. Here are some examples:\n\na = 15\nb = 4 * a\n\nR is particularly good at doing calculations on lists of data. So let’s make some lists!\nRStudio makes a list with the c() command. The “c” in short for “combine”.\n\nP=c(3, 5, 11, -1, 4)\nP\n\n[1]  3  5 11 -1  4\n\n\nIf you want to make a sequence, you use the seq() command. For example:\n\nS=seq(1, 10)\nS\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nNotice that the values increment by 1. You can use a different step size by adding a third argument. For exmaple, if I wanted a sequence 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, etc… all the way up to 2, I would write\n\nT=seq(1, 2, 0.1)\nT\n\n [1] 1.0 1.1 1.2 1.3 1.4 1.5 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0\n\n\nNow look at the Environment tab in the upper right window. What do you notice?\nPro Tips: Be kind to future you as well as current collaborators.\n\nAlways write 0.1 instead of .1 in your code. It is much easier to read and to debug later!\nConsider adding a space after your commas to separate parameters. It’s easier to read!\n\n\nYou Try\nTry to do the following:\n\nCreate a list X containing the values 8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9.\nCreate a list Y containing the sequence of odd integers between (and including) 1 and 19\nWhat is the output of the command `X^2’? Can you see what R is doing?\nTry making another lists. Apply some functions to that list.\n\n\n\n\nFunctions\nNow it’s time to write your own function. Here is how you create \\(f(x)= x^2 -3\\).\n\nf = makeFun(x^2 - 3 ~ x)\n\nMuch of this is pretty intuitive, except for maybe the final ~ x. This tilde symbol comes up a lot in RStudio and it indicates dependence. We need to tell RStudio that \\(f\\) is in terms of this variable \\(x\\), so it knows where to put an input when I ask it to.\nNotice! In the right upper window, you now have a function called f. We can do a lot with this function, but to start, let’s evaluate it at 1.\n\nf(1)\n\n[1] -2\n\n\nWhat do you think this code is doing?\n\nS=seq(1, 10)\nf(S)\n\n [1] -2  1  6 13 22 33 46 61 78 97\n\n\n\nYou Try\n\nCreate a new function \\(g\\) where \\(g(t) = \\sqrt{t-4}\\)\nEvaluate this function at \\(t=8\\), and \\(t=12.34\\) and \\(t=100\\)\nWhat happens when you try to evaluate this function at \\(t=2\\)? What do you think that means?\n\n\n\n\nPlotting\nLet’s see how to create plots using RStudio. First, let’s create a plot of this data\n\n\n\nx\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n\nh(x)\n0\n1\n4\n9\n16\n25\n\n\n\nfrom the function \\(h(x)=x^2\\).\n\nX = seq(0,5)\nY = X^2\ngf_point(Y ~ X)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice! We list the dependent variable Y first and then the independent variable X after the tidle ~ (which matches the syntax of makeFun).\nWe can also plot a function. Once again the dependent variable appears after the tilde.\n\nslice_plot(x^2 ~ x, domain(x=-2:2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can actually plot the data and the function on the same graph. We will plot the data and then add the function by using the add=TRUE parameter for plotFun. I will also use the optional col parameter to change the color of the function curve.\n\ngf_point(Y ~ X) %&gt;%\n  slice_plot(x^2 ~ x, domain(x=0:5),color='red')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou Try\n\nCreate a sequence of integer points P from 1 to 10.\nDefine Q = sin(P)\nCreate a plot of Q versus P and then add the function plot of sin(x)\nTry plotting some other data and fuunctions.",

For \\(f(x)\\), the value increases by \\(0.15\\) for each entry, suggesting a linear function \\(f(x) = mx+b\\). The slope is \\[\nm=\\frac{26.15-26}{20.5-20} = \\frac{0.15}{0.2}=0.3.\n\\] To find the vertical intercept, we plug in \\(x=0\\) to find that \\(26 = 0.3 \\cdot 0 + b\\), so \\(b=26\\). Therefore, \\[\nf=0.3x+26.\n\\] For \\(g(x)\\), we note that each successive value is the previous one multiplied by approximately \\(1.14\\). The points are evenly spaced so we have constant multiplicative change. This is an exponential function \\(g(x) = C a^t.\\)\nWe have \\(g(0) = 190 = C a^0 = C\\), so \\(c=90\\). Next, let’s plug in any other point. We have \\(g(0.5)=217=  190 a^(0.5) = 190 \\sqrt{a}\\) which means that \\(a = (217/190)^2=1.304\\) So \\[ g(x) = 190 (1.304)^t.\\]\n\n\n4.3.4 Interest rate for an investment\nOur initial investment is \\(I_0\\) and we have \\(I(15) = 3 I_0\\).\n\nFor annual compounding, we have \\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n3 I_0 &=& I_0 (1+r)^{15} \\\\\n3  &=&  (1+r)^{15} \\\\\n3^{1/15} &=& 1+r \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\] so \\(r = 3^{1/15} - 1 = 0.076.\\)\nFor continuous compounding, we have \\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n3 I_0 &=& I_0 e^{15r} \\\\\n3  &=&  e^{15r} \\\\\n\\ln (3) &=& 15 r\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\] so \\(r = \\ln(3)/15= 0.073\\).\nThe rate for annual compounding is larger. That makes sense because the interest ``snowballs’’ faster when you compound continuously.\n\n\n\n4.3.5 Exponential decay\nRadioactive cobalt-60 has a half-life of 5.3 years. If the initial amount is 60 grams, find a formula for the amount of cobalt-60 left after \\(t\\) years.\nOur function is \\(f(t) = P_0 a^t\\) where \\(t\\) is time in years, and \\(f(t)\\) is the amount of colbalt-60 in grams. Since \\(60 = f(0) = P_0 a^0\\), we know that \\(P_0 = 60\\). Hence, \\(f(t) = 60 a^t\\). Since The half life is 5.3 years, we know that \\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n30 & = & 60 a^{5.3}\\\\\n\\frac{30}{60} & = & a^{5.3} \\\\\n\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\right) ^ {1/5.3} & = & a \\\\\n0.877 & \\approx & a.\n\\end{array}\n\\] Therefore, \\(f(t) = 60(0.877)^t\\).\n\n\n4.3.6 Doubling time\nWe want to solve \\(f(t)=20\\) for \\(t\\). \\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n20 & = & 10 e^{1.2t}\\\\\n2 & = & e^{1.2t} \\\\\n\\ln(2) &=& 1.2 t\n\\end{array}\n\\] so \\(t = \\ln(2)/1.2 = 0.578\\).\n\n\n4.3.7 People and vehicles\nOur formulas are \\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nv(t) & = & 170(1.04)^t\\\\\np(t) & = & 227(1.01)^t.\n\\end{array}\n\\] 1. We want to solve \\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nv(t) & = & p(t) \\\\\n170(1.04)^t & = & 227(1.01)^t \\\\\n\\left( \\frac{1.04}{1.01} \\right)^t & = & \\frac{227}{170} \\\\\n(1.0297) ^ t & = & 227/170 \\\\\nt \\ln (1.0297) & = & \\ln (1.3353) \\\\\nt & \\approx & 9.87.\n\\end{array}\n\\] Since \\(t\\) is years since 1980, there will be one car per person in the year 1980 + 9.87 = 1989.87, that is, nearly 1990.\n\nHere is a plot of the two functions.\n\n\n\nOur models predict \\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nv(40) & = & 170(1.04)^{40} \\approx 816.17 \\text{ million vehicles}\\\\\np(40) & = & 227(1.01)^{40} \\approx 337.97 \\text{ million people.}\n\\end{array}\n\\] Google says that in 2020, there were about 273.6 million vehicles and 328.2 million people.

    "text": "6.3 Solutions\n\n\nClick for Solutions\n\n\n6.3.1 Periodic function examples\nThere are lots of period functions. How about:\n\nThe average monthly temperature in St Paul. The period of this function is one year, and it looks a lot like a sine function.\nThe traffic on I-94. The period of this function is one week.\nThe number of students in our classrrom. The period of this function is one week.\nThe percentage of the moon that is illuminated. The period of this function is one lunar month.\n\n\n\n6.3.2 Find a periodic formula\n\nHere’s the steps to find the function.\n\n\nThe max value is 3 and the min value is 1. So we have \\[\nA = \\frac{\\max - \\min}{2} = \\frac{3-1}{2} = \\frac{2}{2}=1\n\\] and \\[\nC = \\frac{\\max + \\min}{2} = \\frac{3+1}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2.\n\\]\nThe easiest way to find the period is to look for identifiable points. We reach the minimum at \\(x=-\\pi\\) and \\(x = \\pi\\), and we go through 3 cycles between them. So \\[\nT = \\frac{\\pi - (-\\pi)}{3} = \\frac{2 \\pi}{3}\n\\] which means that \\[\n\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{2 \\pi/3} = 3.\n\\]\nNow we need to choose a function from \\(\\sin\\), \\(-\\sin\\), \\(\\cos\\) and \\(\\cos\\). Hopefully we can pick one that will let us take \\(\\phi=0\\). Looking at the function, we see that it reaches a maximum at \\(x=0\\), which is compatible with \\(\\cos\\).\n\nTherefore, the function is \\[\n\\cos\\left(3x \\right)+2\n\\]\n\nHere’s the steps to find the function.\n\n\nThe center line is 0, so \\(C=0\\).\nThe max value is 7 and the min value is -7. So we have \\[\nA = \\frac{\\max - \\min}{2} = \\frac{7 - (-7)}{2} = \\frac{14}{2}=7.\n\\]\nThe easiest way to find the period is to look for identifiable points. We begin a cycle at at \\(x=0\\) and start the next new cycle at \\(x = 3\\). So \\[\nT = 3 - 0 = 3\n\\] which means that \\[\n\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}.\n\\]\nNow we need to choose a function from \\(\\sin\\), \\(-\\sin\\), \\(\\cos\\) and \\(\\cos\\). Hopefully we can pick one that will let us take \\(\\phi=0\\). Looking at the function, we see that it starts a cycle \\(x=0\\), but is decreasing, and this compatible with \\(-\\sin\\).\n\nTherefore, the function is \\[\n-7 \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3} x \\right).\n\\]\n\n\n6.3.3 Variable star\nThe amplitude is \\((10-2)/2=4\\) and the vertical shift is \\((10+2)/2=6\\). The period is 332 days, so our formula is \\[ 4 \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi}{335} t\\right).\\]\n\n\n6.3.4 Tides and currents\nThe current speed uses the vertical axis on the left. The maximum is 3 and the minimum is -3. So the amplitude is 3 and there is no vertical shift. The maximuum is achieved at \\(t=0\\), so we can just use a cosine curve: \\[\nc(t) = 3 \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi}{12.415} t \\right)\n\\]\nThe water level is modeled by a cosine curve shifted to the right. The water level has amplitude \\((5.5 - (-0.5))/2) = 6/2=3\\) and vertical shift \\((5.5 + (-0.5))/2) = 3\\). The period is \\(12.415\\) hours, and we must shift to the right by one fourth of that amount, so \\(\\phi=-12.415/4 \\approx  -3.1\\). So \\[ w(t) = 3 \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi}{12.415} ( t - 3.1) \\right)  +3\\]\n\n\n6.3.5 Rainfall in Seattle\nThe amplitude is about \\(5/2=2.5\\) and the vertical shift is \\(7/2=3.5\\). The period is 12 months. We reach our peak in December, so we must shift a cosine curve to the left by \\(\\phi=1\\) unit. So our function is \\[ r(t) = 2.5 \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{12} ( t + 1) \\right) + 3.5.\\]",

The interpretation: for every hour that you spend studying, your grade increases by \\(4.67\\%\\).\nThis rate of change is not constant. After studying for a while, you reach “burn out”, or perhaps you run out of new material to master. In addition, your grade tops out at 100%, so we cannot increase forever.\n\n\n\n9.3.2 Marginal Cost\n\nThe marginal cost is \\[\n\\frac{250,440 - 250,000}{102-100}=\\frac{440}{2} =220 \\mbox{ dollars per phone}\n\\]\nI estimate that the cost of making 1030 phones is \\[\n250,000 + 200 \\cdot 30 = 256,600.\n\\]\n\n\n\n9.3.3 Farmland in the United States\n\nWhen estimating the derivative, we need to “stay local” in order to get the most reliable estimate. There are three equally good choices here: \\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nf'(1995) &\\approx& \\frac{f(2000)-f(1995)}{2000-1995}=\\frac{945-963}{5} = - \\frac{18}{5} = -3.6 \\\\\nf'(1995) &\\approx& \\frac{f(1995)-f(1990)}{1995-1990}=\\frac{963-987}{5} = - \\frac{24}{5} = -4.8 \\\\\nf'(1995) &\\approx& \\frac{f(2000)-f(1990)}{2000-1990}=\\frac{945-987}{10} = - \\frac{42}{10} = -4.2 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nAny of the three estimates are good answers. Since we are estimating there isn’t a “right answer.” All three stay close to 1995, so each one is good.\nWe got a negative number because the acreage is decreasing.\nIf we had the data for 1994 or 1996, using these values would give us a better estimate. Using smaller and smaller intervals will give us a more accurate estimation. (But we cannot tell up front how “small” we need to be to get the accurracy we desire.)\n\n\n\n9.3.4 A Moving Particle\n\nUsing desmos, we know that \\[\ns'(1) \\approx \\frac{s(1+h)-s(1)}{h} \\approx -5.44\n\\] when \\(0 &lt; h &lt; 0.00001\\). Similarly, we have \\[\ns'(1) \\approx \\frac{s(2+h)-s(2)}{h} \\approx 5.03\n\\] when \\(0 &lt; h &lt; 0.00001\\).\nHere are the commands to plot the curve and the two tangent lines.\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{l}\ns\\left(t\\right)=2+3\\sin(4t)+1.2t^{2} \\\\\n\\\\\ny = -5.44(t-1) + s(1) \\\\\n\\\\\ny = 5.03(t-2) + s(2) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\n\n9.3.5 Sketch the derivative\nHere are the derivative curves for the given curves.",

In other words, the second derivative remains near zero around the point \\(x=a\\)\nIf the curve has a lot of concavity near the point \\(x=a\\) then then tangent line is not a good approximation. This is because the curve bends away from the tangent line.\n\n\n\n12.3.3 Estimating a Function\n\nUsing desmos, I found that \\(f(2)=11.39\\) and \\(f'(2)=19.39\\).

If the rate at which gas is consumed is 0.06 gallons per mile, and if the car is traveling at 40 miles per hour, how fast is the gas being used?\n\nWe have a gasoline function \\(G(s)\\) for distance \\(s\\), and a distance function \\(s(t)\\) for time \\(t\\). We have \\[\n\\frac{d G}{ds} \\cdot \\frac{ds}{dt} = \\left( 0.06 \\, \\frac{\\mbox{gallons}}{\\mbox{mile}} \\right) \\left( 40 \\, \\frac{\\mbox{miles}}{\\mbox{hour}} \\right)\n= 2.4 \\, \\frac{\\mbox{gallons}}{\\mbox{hour}}\n\\]\n\nThe radius of a circular oil spill is increasing at a rate of 2 meters per minute. Find how fast the area is changing when \\(r=50\\) meters?\n\nWe have area \\(A(r)=\\pi^{r^2}\\), so \\(\\frac{dA}{dr} = 2\\pi r\\). When \\(r=50\\), this rate of change is \\(100 \\pi\\) meters/minute. Therefore \\[\n\\frac{d A}{dr} \\cdot \\frac{dr}{dt} = \\left( 100 \\pi \\, \\frac{\\mbox{m}^2}{\\mbox{m}} \\right) \\left( 2 \\, \\frac{\\mbox{m}}{\\mbox{min}} \\right)\n= 200\\pi \\, \\frac{\\mbox{m}^2}{\\mbox{min}}\n\\] Aside: It’s really interesting that the rate of change of the area (with respect to radius \\(r\\)) is \\(2\\pi r\\), which is the circumference of the circle! This make a lot of sense: the circumference is the boundary of the area, so its expansion captures the expansion of the area.\n\n\n15.3.4 Visual Chain Rule Problem\n\nWe want \\((f'(g(3)) g'(3)\\). We have \\(g(3)=5\\) and \\(f'(5)=1\\). However \\(g'(3)\\) is not defined because \\(x=3\\) is a cusp point for \\(g(x)\\). So the derivative of \\(f(g(x))\\) does not exist at \\(x=3\\).\nWe want \\((g'(f(1)) f'(1)\\). We have \\(f(1)=4\\) and \\(g'(4)=0\\) and \\(f'(1)=-2\\). So our answer is \\[(g'(f(1)) f'(1) = g'(4) f'(1) = 0.\\]\nWe want \\((g'(f(2)) f'(2)\\). We have \\(f(2)=2\\) and \\(g'(2)=2/3\\) and \\(f'(2)=-2\\). So our answer is \\[(g'(f(2)) f'(2) = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot (-2) = -\\frac{4}{3}.\\]",

The function never decreases as we move from \\(0\\) to \\(2\\pi\\).So \\(x=0\\) is the global minimum, and \\(x=2\\pi\\) is the global maximum.\n\n\n18.3.3 Visual First Derivative Test\n\nThere are two local minima.\n\n\nThe endpoint \\(x=0\\) is a local minimum because the function increases after leaving this point.\nThe point \\(x=6\\) is a local minimum because the derivative changes from negative to positive at this point.\n\n\nThere are two local maxima.\n\n\nThe point \\(x=1\\) is a local maximum because the derivative changes from positive to negative at this point.\nThe endpoint \\(x=7\\) is a local maximum because the function increases up to this point.\n\n\nThe points of inflection occur at the local minima and local maxima of this derivative function \\(f'(x)\\). These occur at the points \\(x=1.6\\) and \\(x=3\\) and \\(x=5.2\\)\n\n\n\n18.3.4 Second Derivative Test\nThe function \\(f(x) = x^4-8 x^3+22 x^2-24 x\\) has critical points at \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=2\\) and \\(x=3\\).\n\nWe have \\[f'(x) = 4x^3 - 24 x^2 + 44 x - 24\\] and \\[ f''(x) = 12x^2 - 48x + 44.\\]\nWe check the critical points \\(x=1\\), \\(x=2\\) and \\(x=3\\). \\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\nf''(1) &=& 12 - 48 + 44 = 8 &gt; 0 \\\\\nf''(2) &=& 48 - 96 + 44 = -2 &lt; 0 \\\\\nf''(3) &=& 108 - 144 + 44 &gt; 0 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nTherefore \\(x=1\\) and \\(x=3\\) are local minima and \\(x=2\\) is a local maximum.\n\n\n18.3.5 Second Derivative Test 2\nConsider the function \\(f(x) = 2x^5 - 5x^2 + 10\\).\n\nWe have \\(f'(x)=10x^4 - 10x = 10x(x^3 -1)\\). The critical points are \\(x=0\\) and \\(x=1\\).\nWe have \\(f''(x)= 40x^3 - 10\\). Considering \\(x=0\\), we have \\(f''(0) = -10 &lt; 0\\), so \\(x=0\\) is a local maximum. As for \\(x=1\\), we have \\(f''(1) = 30 &gt; 0\\), so \\(x=1\\) is a local minimum.\n\n\n\n18.3.6 Fenced Garden Design\n\nThere are 3 horizontal fences of length \\(x\\) and \\(4\\) vertical fences of length \\(y\\). So the total length of the fences satisfies \\[\n1200 = 3x + 4y.\n\\]\nSolving the equation in part 1 for \\(y\\) gives \\[\ny = 300 - \\frac{3}{4} x.\n\\] Therefore the formula for the area is \\[\nA(x) = x \\left(300 - \\frac{3}{4} x \\right) = 300x - \\frac{3}{4}x^2.\n\\]\nThe derivative of the area is \\[\nA'(x) = 300 - \\frac{3}{2}x.\n\\] Setting this equal to zero and solving gives \\(x=200\\). The second derivative of the area is \\[\nA''(x) = - \\frac{3}{2} &lt; 0\n\\] So this critical point is a local maximum by the second derivative test.\nWe have \\(x=200\\) and therefore \\(y=300 - 600/4 = 300-150=150.\\) So the total area of the garden is \\[\n200 \\cdot 150 = 30,000 \\mbox{ ft}^2\n\\]\n\n\n\n18.3.7 Cupcake Store\nA cupcake store finds that at a price of $4.00, the demand is 400 cupcakes. For every $1 increase in price, the demand decreases by 80 cupcakes.\n\nThe revenue function is \\[r(x) = (4+x)(400-80x) = 1600 + 80x - 80x^2.\\]\nTo find the price and quantity that maximize the revenue, we set the derivative equal to 0. This gives \\[\nr'(x) = 80 - 160x = 0\n\\] and solving gives \\[\nx=1/2.\n\\] Furthermore, the second derivative is \\(r''(x) = -160 &lt; 0\\) so this point is a maximum.\n\nThe optimal price is $4.50 and the maximal revenue is \\[\nr(1/2)= 1600 + 40 - 20 = 1620.\n\\]",

This takes a small step in the uphill direction.\n\nslopex=partialx(newx, newy)\nslopey=partialy(newx, newy)\nnewx = newx + 0.05*slopex\nnewy = newy + 0.05*slopey\n# print new partial derivatives\nc(partialx(newx, newy), partialy(newx, newy))\n# print new point\nc(newx, newy)\n\nRepeatedly run this code block until the partial derivatives are essentially zero (at least two zeros after the decimal point). Congrats! You have found your local maximum.\nYou will end at the point (1.04,0.77). But note that starting at another initial point might take you to a different local maximum!\nYou can check that this critical point is a local maximum (and not a saddle point) by using the same method that we used for 2D Optimizatiion\n\nf = makeFun( -x^4 - x^3 + 10*x*y + 2* y - 8* y^2 ~ x&y)\na=1.0405\nb=0.7753\nr = 0.1\ntheta = seq(0,2*pi,pi/10)\nf(a,b) - f(a+r*cos(theta), b+r*sin(theta))\n\n [1] 0.10152236 0.06983861 0.04586756 0.03913009 0.05231624 0.07998000\n [7] 0.11073639 0.13203698 0.13536588 0.11957064 0.09102447 0.06080448\n[13] 0.04028374 0.03696369 0.05199590 0.08002000 0.11113281 0.13426810\n[19] 0.14099672 0.12862949 0.10152236",

We have \\(v(t) &gt; 0\\) for \\(t &lt; 5\\) and \\(v(t) &lt; 0\\) for \\(t &gt; 5\\).\nWe must look at the signed area. When is the (positive) area above the \\(x\\)-axis equal to the (negative) area below the \\(x\\)-axis? This happens at \\(t=12\\). So this is the time that the car returns to where it started.\n\n\n\n24.4.2 Accelerate My Car\nSee the class slides for a visual explanation of this problem. Here is a descriptive solution.\n\nThe car’s velocity is increasing at \\(t=2\\) because acceleration is positive. The car’s velocity is decreasing at \\(t=15\\) because acceleration is negative\nAt \\(t=6\\), the acceleration is zero. We accelerate up to this point, and we decelerate after this point. So it is a local maximum for velocity.\nThe velocity is 55 feet per second at \\(t=12\\) because the area above the \\(x\\)-axis (positive acceleration so far) equals the area below the \\(x\\)-axis (negative acceleration so far).\nThe maximum velocity occurs at \\(t=6\\)? The car accelerates for the first 6 seconds. Then it decelerates for the next 10 seconds (until \\(t=16\\)). Then it accelerates again for 2 seconds. However by \\(t=18\\), the total deceleration (area below the \\(x\\)-axis) is more than the total acceleration.\nThe minimum velocity occurs at \\(t=12\\). This is when we’ve seen the most deceleration, and we’ve decelerated more than we’ve accelerated.\n\n\n\n24.4.3 Making Cupcakes\nThe marginal cost of making cupcakes is given by \\[K'(q)=\\frac{1}{100}q^2+\\frac{1}{5}q+1,\\] where \\(q\\) is in dozens of cupcakes.\n\nBy the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral that calculates \\(K(30)-K(0)\\) is\n\n\\[\\int_0^{30} K'(q) dq = \\int_0^{30} \\left( \\frac{1}{100}q^2+\\frac{1}{5}q+1 \\right) dq\n\\]\n\nHere is our RStudio estimate.\n\n\nf=makeFun(1/100 * q^2 + 1/5*q + 1 ~ q)\na = 0\nb = 30\nnum = 100000\n### the approximation of f(x) on interval [a,b]\nbase = (b-a)/num\npoints = seq(from=a+base, to=b, by=base)\nheights = f(points)\nareas = base*heights\nsum(areas)\n\n[1] 210.0023\n\n\n\nThe total costs are approximate \\(1500+210\\), which is the sum of our fixed costs and our production costs.\n\n\n\n24.4.4 Area Between Curves\n\nThe sine curve and the cosine curve intersect when \\(x=\\pi/4\\) and \\(x=5\\pi/4\\). The cosine curve is above the sine curve on \\([0,\\pi/4]\\). Then the sine curve is on top on \\([\\pi/4,5\\pi/4]\\). Then cosine is back on top on \\([5\\pi/4, 2\\pi\\). So the area is \\[\\int_{\\pi/4}^{5\\pi/4} ( \\cos(x) - \\sin(x)) dx  + \\int_{\\pi/4}^{5\\pi/4} ( \\sin(x) - \\cos(x)) dx + \\int_{5\\pi/4}^{2\\pi} ( \\cos(x) - \\sin(x)) dx.\\]\nOur RStudio estimates for each part are\n\n\nf=makeFun(cos(x) - sin(x) ~ x)\na = 0\nb = pi /4\nnum = 100000\n### the approximation of f(x) on interval [a,b]\nbase = (b-a)/num\npoints = seq(from=a+base, to=b, by=base)\nheights = f(points)\nareas = base*heights\nsum(areas)\n\n[1] 0.4142096\n\n\n\nf=makeFun(sin(x) - cos(x) ~ x)\na = pi/4\nb = 5* pi /4\nnum = 100000\n### the approximation of f(x) on interval [a,b]\nbase = (b-a)/num\npoints = seq(from=a+base, to=b, by=base)\nheights = f(points)\nareas = base*heights\nsum(areas)\n\n[1] 2.828427\n\n\n\nf=makeFun(cos(x) - sin(x) ~ x)\na = 5*pi/4\nb = 2*pi \nnum = 100000\n### the approximation of f(x) on interval [a,b]\nbase = (b-a)/num\npoints = seq(from=a+base, to=b, by=base)\nheights = f(points)\nareas = base*heights\nsum(areas)\n\n[1] 2.414225\n\n\nSo our estimate of the area is\n\n0.414 + 2.828 + 2.414\n\n[1] 5.656",

So the curves intersect at \\(x=\\pm 2\\).\nOn the interval \\([-2, 2]\\), function \\(f(x)\\) is above function \\(g(x)\\).\nThe area between these curves is \\[\n\\int_{-2}^{2} ( f(x) -g(x)) dx\n=\n\\int_{-2}^{2} ( 8 -2x^2) dx\n\\]\nLet’s use RStudio. It’s easier!\n\n\nf=makeFun(8 - 2*x^2 ~ x)\na = -2 \nb = 2 \nnum = 100000\n### the approximation of f(x) on interval [a,b]\nbase = (b-a)/num\npoints = seq(from=a+base, to=b, by=base)\nheights = f(points)\nareas = base*heights\nsum(areas)\n\n[1] 21.33333\n\n\n\n\n25.3.4 Average Value\n\nThe average value of \\(\\sin(x)\\) on \\([0, \\pi]\\) is \\[\n\\frac{1}{\\pi} \\int_0^{\\pi} \\sin(x) dx =\n\\left. - \\frac{1}{\\pi}  \\cos(x) \\right|_{0}^{\\pi}\n= - \\frac{1}{\\pi} (\\cos(\\pi) - \\cos(0))\n= \\frac{2}{\\pi}\n\\]\nThe average value of \\(e^{2x}\\) on \\([0,5]\\) is \\[\n\\frac{1}{5} \\int_0^{5} e^{2x} dx =\n\\left.  \\frac{1}{5} \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} e^{2x} \\right|_{0}^{5}\n= \\frac{1}{10} (e^{10} - 1)\n\\]\nThe average value of \\(x^2 + 3\\) on \\([4,6]\\) is\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{6-4} \\int_4^{6} (x^2 + 3) dx = \\left.  \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{3} x^3 + 3x \\right) \\right|_{4}^{6} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(\\frac{6^3}{3} + 18 -  \\frac{4^3}{3} - 12 \\right)= 28.33\n\\]\n\n\n25.3.5 Modeling Population Growth\nThe second phase of bacteria growth is called the . The rate of population growth is proportional to the number of bacteria at that time with proportionality constant 0.003. In other words\n\\[\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.003 P\n\\]\nThis is equivalent to the integration formula \\[\n\\int \\frac{1}{P} \\, dP = \\int 0.003 \\, dt.\n\\]\n\nIntegrate both sides of this equation and find a general equation for \\(P\\).\n\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\int \\frac{1}{P} \\, dP &=& \\int 0.003 \\, dt \\\\\n\\ln(P) &=& 0.003t + C \\\\\nP &=& K e^{0.003t}\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nwhere \\(K = e^C\\).\n\nWe know that \\(P(t) = K e^{0.003t}\\) and that \\(P(0)=1000\\). This means that \\(K=1000\\). So our function is \\[\nP(t) = 1000 e^{0.003t}.\n\\]\n\n\n\n25.3.6 Zombie Apocalypse\nThe rate \\(r(t)\\) at which people become zombies during the inevitable zombie apocalypse can be approximated by \\[ r(t)=1000 e^{-0.5t}\\] where \\(T\\) is the number of days since the start of the outbreak.\n\nThe number of infected people is \\[I(T) = \\int_0^T r(t) \\, dt = \\int_0^T 1000 e^{-0.5t} \\, dt\\]\nWe have \\[\n\\int_0^T 1000 e^{-0.5t} \\, dt = \\left. \\frac{1000}{-0.5} e^{-0.5t} \\right|_0^T = - \\frac{1000}{0.5} e^{-0.5 T} + \\frac{1000}{0.5} e^{0} = 2000 \\left( 1 - \\frac{1}{e^{0.5 T}}\\right).\n\\] For very large \\(T\\) the second term is basically 0. So we have 2000 zombies by the end of the outbreak. Gosh, that’s not too bad!",

So there is not a single “right answer” here.

This adds a new term, based on the vaccination rate. For example: \\[\n\\frac{dS}{dt} = -aSI - cS, \\qquad \\frac{dI}{dt} = aSI - bI, \\qquad \\frac{dR}{dt} = bI + cS,\n\\] where \\(0 &lt; c &lt; 1\\) is the rate at which susceptible people are vaccinated.\n\n\n31.3.4 Changing Infection Rate Versus Changing Removal Rate\n\nThe peak infected population is about 185.

There are about 235 susceptible people left at the end of the outbreak, which lasts about 100 days.\n\n\nSIRdyn = makeODE(dS ~ - 0.0005*S*I, \n                  dI ~  0.0005*S*I -.2*I )\nSoln = integrateODE(SIRdyn, domain(t=0:100), S=600, I=8)\n\nSolution containing functions S(t), I(t).\n\ntraj_plot(I(t) ~ S(t), Soln, nt=20)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the removal time is doubled, the peak infected population is 46, and this occurs at \\(t=14.5\\).
