### Fenced Garden Design

A gardener has 1200 feet of fencing. This fencing will be used to create a 3 by 2 rectangular grid of garden plots, as shown below. They want to pick the dimensions $x$ and $y$ that will maximize the area $xy$ of the rectangular plot.

![](../images/3by2grid.png)

1. Explain why the dimensions $x$ and $y$ of the plot satisfy
$$
3x + 4y = 1200
$$

2. Solve the equation in part 1 for $y$, and then use this formula for $y$ to  find an equation for the area $A(x)$ that only depends upon $x$.

3. Now find the critical point of $A(x)$ and show that it corresponds to a global maximum.

4. Using your answer from part 3, what are the optimal dimensions for the garden, and what is its area?

### Characterize the Extrema

1.  We have three different functions

-   $f(x) = x^3$ has no extrema
-   $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2+1}$ has a global maximum at $x=1$
-   $f(x) = \cos(x)$ has global maxima at $x=2k \pi$ for every integer $k$. It has global minima at $x=(2k+1) \pi$ for every integer $k$.

2.  Once again we have three functions

-   LEFT: global maximum at $x=0$; local maximum at $x=4$. Note that $x=2$ is not a local minimum.
-   MIDDLE: local maximum at $x=1$; global minimum at $x=2$; global maximum at $x=4$.
-   RIGHT: global minimum at $x=0$. Note that $x=2$ is not a global maximum (because the function is not defined at $x=2$).

### First Derivative Test

Find the critical point(s) of the following functions. Then use the first derivative test to determine whether it is a local minimum, a local maximum, or neither

1. We have $f(x) = x^4 + 8 x^3 + 16 x^2$ and so
$f'(x)=4x^3+24x^2+32x$. We can factor this as
$$
f'(x) = 4x(x^2+6x+8) = 4x(x+2)(x+4).
$$
There are three critical points: $x=0$ and $x=-2$ and $x=-4$. The first derivative test gives the diagram:

````{verbatim}
   -      +        -       +
-------o-------o-------o--------
      -4      -2       0

````
So $-4$ is a local minimum, $-2$ is a local maximum, and $0$ is a local minimum.

2.  We have $g(x) = x - e^x$ and so $g'(x) = 1 - e^x$. There is one critical point: $$
    \begin{array}{rcl}
    1-e^x &=& 0 \\
    e^x &=& 1 \\
    x &=& 0.
    \end{array}
    $$ Using the first derivative test, we have $g'(-1) = 1 - e^{-1} > 0$ and $g'(1) = 1 - e < 0$. This leads to the first derivative diagram:

````{verbatim}
   +       -
-------o-------
       0     
````    
    
  Therefore $x=0$ is a local maximum.

3.  We have $h(x) = x + \sin(x)$ and therefore $h'(x) = 1 + \sin(x)$. There is one critical point: $$
    \begin{array}{rcl}
    1 + \cos(x) &=& 0 \\
    \cos(x) &=& -1 \\
    x &=& \pi
    \end{array}
    $$

We have $h'(\pi/2) = 1 > 0$ and $h'(3 \pi/2) = 1 > 0$. (In fact, $1+\cos(x)$ is never negative.) This leads to the first derivative diagram:

````{verbatim}
   +       +
-------o-------
      pi/2     
````

Therefore the point $x=\pi/2$ is not an extremum.

To find all the extrema of $h(x)$, we need to consider the endpoints of $[0,2\pi]$. The function never decreases as we move from $0$ to $2\pi$.So $x=0$ is the global minimum, and $x=2\pi$ is the global maximum.

### Visual First Derivative Test

1. There are two local minima.

  - The endpoint $x=0$ is a local minimum because the function increases after leaving this point.
  - The point $x=6$ is a local minimum because the derivative changes from negative to positive at this point.

2. There are two local maxima.

  - The point $x=1$ is a local maximum because the derivative changes from positive to negative at this point.
  - The endpoint $x=7$ is a local maximum because the function increases up to this point.

3. The points of inflection occur at the local minima and local maxima of this derivative function $f'(x)$. These occur at the points $x=1.6$ and $x=3$ and $x=5.2$



### Second Derivative Test

The function $f(x) = x^4-8 x^3+22 x^2-24 x$ has critical points at $x=1$ and $x=2$ and $x=3$.

1.  We have $$f'(x) = 4x^3 - 24 x^2 + 44 x - 24$$ and $$ f''(x) = 12x^2 - 48x + 44.$$
2.  We check the critical points $x=1$, $x=2$ and $x=3$. $$
    \begin{array}{rcl}
    f''(1) &=& 12 - 48 + 44 = 8 > 0 \\
    f''(2) &=& 48 - 96 + 44 = -2 < 0 \\
    f''(3) &=& 108 - 144 + 44 > 0 \\
    \end{array}
    $$

Therefore $x=1$ and $x=3$ are local minima and $x=2$ is a local maximum.

### Second Derivative Test 2

Consider the function $f(x) = 2x^5 - 5x^2 + 10$.

1. We have $f'(x)=10x^4 - 10x = 10x(x^3 -1)$. The critical points are $x=0$ and $x=1$.

2. We have $f''(x)= 40x^3 - 10$. Considering $x=0$, we have $f''(0) = -10 < 0$, so $x=0$ is a local maximum. As for $x=1$, we have $f''(1) = 30 > 0$, so $x=1$ is a local minimum.

### Fenced Garden Design

1. There are 3 horizontal fences of length $x$ and $4$ vertical fences of length $y$. So the total length of the fences satisfies
$$
1200 = 3x + 4y.
$$
2. Solving the equation in part 1 for $y$ gives
$$
y = 300 - \frac{3}{4} x.
$$
Therefore the formula for the area is
$$
A(x) = x \left(300 - \frac{3}{4} x \right) = 300x - \frac{3}{4}x^2.
$$

3. The derivative of the area is
$$
A'(x) = 300 - \frac{3}{2}x.
$$
Setting this equal to zero and solving gives $x=200$.
The second derivative of the area is
$$
A''(x) = - \frac{3}{2} < 0
$$
So this critical point is a local maximum by the second derivative test.

4. We have $x=200$ and therefore $y=300 - 600/4 = 300-150=150.$ So the total area of the garden is
$$
200 \cdot 150 = 30,000 \mbox{ ft}^2
$$


### Cupcake Store


A cupcake store finds that at a price of \$4.00, the demand is 400 cupcakes. For every $1 increase in price, the demand decreases by 80 cupcakes. 

1. The revenue function is
$$r(x) = (4+x)(400-80x) = 1600 + 80x - 80x^2.$$ 


2. To find the price and quantity that maximize the revenue, we set the derivative equal to 0. This gives
$$
r'(x) = 80 - 160x = 0
$$
and solving gives
$$
x=1/2.
$$
Furthermore, the second derivative is $r''(x) = -160 < 0$ so this point is a maximum.

The optimal price is \$4.50 and the maximal revenue is
$$
r(1/2)= 1600 + 40 - 20 = 1620.
$$
