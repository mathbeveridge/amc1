Ask a question about reality.\n2.  Make some observations and collect the corresponding data.\n3.  Conjecture a model or modify a known model based on the data.\n4.  Test the model against known data (from step 2.) and modify the model as needed.\n5.  Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4 to improve the model\n\n## Activities\n\n### Life insurance\n\nA family needs to purchase life insurance. What possible inputs might be used to determine the premium (monthly payment) for life insurance?\n\n### Bat species\n\nIn the Andes mountains in Peru, the number $N$ of species of bats is a *function* of the elevation $h$ in feet above sea level.\n\n1.  What is the independent variable?\n2.  What is the dependent variable?\n3.  Interpret the statement $f(500)=200$ if $f$ represents this function.\n4.  Do you expect this function to be increasing or decreasing? Why?\n\n### Slope and concavity\n\nSketch each of the following:\n\n1.  An increasing function that is concave up\n2.  An increasing function that is concave down\n3.  A decreasing function that is concave up\n4.  A decreasing function that is concave down\n\n### Relative change of the Dow Jones average\n\nThe *relative change* of a function $f(x)$ on interval $[a,b]$ is $$ \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{f(a)}.$$\n\n1.  What is the *relative change* in the Dow Jones average from 169.84 to 77.90 (from 1 January 1931 to 31 December 1931)?\n2.  Compare this to the *relative change* in the Dow Jones average from 35,443.82 to 35,369.09 (from 2 September 2021 to 3 September 2021).\n\n### Measuring rainfall\n\nOne rainy summer day, measurements were recorded (in inches) from a rain gauge every hour.\n\n| **Time**   | 8 am | 9    | 10  | 11   | noon | 1 pm | 2    | 3    | 4    | 5 pm |\n|------------|------|------|-----|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| **Amount** | 0.15 | 0.17 | 0.2 | 0.45 | 0.48 | 0.75 | 1.03 | 1.20 | 1.45 | 1.60 |\n\n1.  What was the average rate of rainfall from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.?\n2.  What are the units of this rate of change?\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n## Solutions\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click for Solutions</summary>\n\n### Life insurance\n\nHere are some possible inputs. There are many more.\n\nAge, gender, whether you smoke, blood pressure, BMI, pre-existing, health conditions, family health history, amount of insurance requested\n\n### Bat species\n\n1.  The independent variable is the elevation $h$\n2.  The dependent variable is the number $N$ of species of bats.\n3.  The statement $f(500)=200$ means that there are 200 species of bats at the height of 500 feet.\n4.  I expect that this function will be decreasing because, in general, there are fewer flora and fauna at higher altitudes.\n\n### Slope and concavity\n\nSketch each of the following:\n\n1.
