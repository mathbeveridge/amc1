The car turns around at $t=5$. We have $v(t) > 0$ for $t < 5$ and $v(t) < 0$ for $t > 5$.\n\n3.  We must look at the signed area. When is the (positive) area above the $x$-axis equal to the (negative) area below the $x$-axis? This happens at $t=12$. So this is the time that the car returns to where it started.\n\n### Accelerate My Car\n\n*See the class slides for a visual explanation of this problem. Here is a descriptive solution.*\n\n1.  The car's velocity is **increasing** at $t=2$ because acceleration is positive. The car's velocity is **decreasing** at $t=15$ because acceleration is negative\n\n2.  At $t=6$, the acceleration is zero. We accelerate up to this point, and we decelerate after this point. So it is a local maximum for velocity.\n\n3.  The velocity is 55 feet per second at $t=12$ because the area above the $x$-axis (positive acceleration so far) equals the area below the $x$-axis (negative acceleration so far).\n\n4.  The **maximum** velocity occurs at $t=6$? The car accelerates for the first 6 seconds. Then it decelerates for the next 10 seconds (until $t=16$). Then it accelerates again for 2 seconds. However by $t=18$, the total deceleration (area below the $x$-axis) is more than the total acceleration.\n\n5.  The **minimum** velocity occurs at $t=12$. This is when we've seen the most deceleration, and we've decelerated more than we've accelerated.\n\n### Making Cupcakes\n\nThe marginal cost of making cupcakes is given by $$K'(q)=\\frac{1}{100}q^2+\\frac{1}{5}q+1,$$ where $q$ is in dozens of cupcakes.\n\n1.  By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, the definite integral that calculates $K(30)-K(0)$ is\n\n$$\\int_0^{30} K'(q) dq = \\int_0^{30} \\left( \\frac{1}{100}q^2+\\frac{1}{5}q+1 \\right) dq \n$$\n\n2.  Here is our *RStudio* estimate.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nf=makeFun(1/100 * q^2 + 1/5*q + 1 ~ q)\na = 0\nb = 30\nnum = 100000\n### the approximation of f(x) on interval [a,b]\nbase = (b-a)/num\npoints = seq(from=a+base, to=b, by=base)\nheights = f(points)\nareas = base*heights\nsum(areas)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 210.0023\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n3.  The total costs are approximate $1500+210$, which is the sum of our fixed costs and our production costs.\n\n### Area Between Curves\n\n1.  The sine curve and the cosine curve intersect when $x=\\pi/4$ and $x=5\\pi/4$. The cosine curve is above the sine curve on $[0,\\pi/4]$. Then the sine curve is on top on $[\\pi/4,5\\pi/4]$. Then cosine is back on top on $[5\\pi/4, 2\\pi$. So the area is $$\\int_{\\pi/4}^{5\\pi/4} ( \\cos(x) - \\sin(x)) dx  + \\int_{\\pi/4}^{5\\pi/4} ( \\sin(x) - \\cos(x)) dx + \\int_{5\\pi/4}^{2\\pi} ( \\cos(x) - \\sin(x)) dx.$$\n\n2.
