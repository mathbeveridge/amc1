This includes radioactive decay, and the metabolization of a drug in the bloodstream.\n\n#### Exponential Growth/Decay with Constant Input/Output\n\nThe differential equation $$\\frac{dP}{dt} = r (P-A)$$ is exponential growth/decay with constant input/output. Its solution is $$P(t) = A + C e^{r \\, t}.$$ When $k >0$ and $H =rA$, we have the population model $$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = rP-H\n$$ for exponential growth at rate $r$ with constant harvesting at rate $H$.\n\n#### Constrained Growth\n\nThe differential equation $$\\frac{dP}{dt} = r \\, P \\left(1 - \\frac{P}{K}\\right)$$ has the logistic function as its solution $$P(t) = \\frac{K}{1+ C e^{-r \\, t}}.$$ When $r>0$ and $K>0$, we have constrained growth at rate $r$ with carrying capacity $K$.\n\n#### Newton's Law of Cooling\n\nNewton's Law of Cooling states that the rate of change of temperature of an object $\\frac{dT}{dt}$ is related to the ambient temperature $A$ by the equation: \\[ \\frac{dT}{dt}=r(T-A).\\] Note that this is the same differential equation as exponential growth with constant harvesting.\n\n## Activities\n\n### Drug Metabolization\n\n1.  After a drug is administered in a single injection, the rate at which the drug leaves the body is proportional to the quantity $Q$ present.\n    a.  What differential equation models this process?\n    b.  Suppose that 10 mg of a drug is injected into the bloodstream. 3 hours later, only 2 mg remains in the bloodstream. Find the formula for the amount of the drug $Q(t)$, in mg, after $t$ hours.\n2.  Suppose that a drug is being administered at a constant rate of 60 mg/hour and its decreasing at a rate of 20% of the amount present.\n    a.  What differential equation models this process?\n    b.  Assuming that $Q(t)=0$, find the formula for the amount of drug $Q(t)$, in mg, after $t$ hours.\n    c.  What value does $Q(t)$ converge to for large values of $t$?\n\n### Elementary, My Dear Watson\n\nIn a mystery novel, the body of a murder victim is found at noon in a room with a constant temperature of $20^\\circ C$. At noon, the body is $35^\\circ C$ and at 2 pm the body is $33^\\circ C$. Normal body temperature is $37^\\circ C$. What time did the murder occur?\n\n### Optimal Coffee Temperature\n\nIn my $22^\\circ C$ office, my coffee starts at $80^\\circ C$, but cools to $75^\\circ C$ after 10 minutes. If I like my coffee between $63^\\circ C$ and $70^\\circ C$, how long is my window to drink it?\n\n### Constrained Rabbit Population\n\nThe yearly population $P(t)$ of rabbits is modeled by $$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.45 P  \\left(1 - \\frac{P}{90} \\right).\n$$\n\n1.  If the current population is $P=120$, will the population increase or decrease? How do you know?\n2.  For what values of $P$ is $\\frac{dP}{dt}=0$?\n3.  What value does $P(t)$ converge to for large values of $t$?\n\n### Constrained Deer Population\n\nThe annual population $P(t)$ of deer is modeled by the constrained growth equation $$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.22 P - 0.0275 P^2.\n$$\n\n1.  What is the growth rate $r$?\n2.  What is the carrying capacity $K$?\n3.  How large is the deer population when that population is growing at its fastest rate? How fast is the population growing at that time?\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n## Solutions\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click for Solutions</summary>\n\n### Drug Metabolization\n\n1.  This is an exponential decay function.\n    a.  $\\displaystyle={\\frac{dQ}{dt} = rQ}$\n    b.  The solution is expoential decay $Q(t) = Ce^{rt}$. We have $Q(0) = 10 = C e^{r\\cdot 0} = C$. So $Q(t) = 10e^{rt}$, Next we have $Q(3) = 2 = 10 e^{3r}$ so $r = \\frac{1}{3} \\ln (1/5) = -0.537$. Our final formula is $Q(t) = 10 e^{-0537t}$.\n2.  Suppose that a drug is being administered at a constant rate of 60 mg/hour and its decreasing at a rate of 20% of the amount present.\n    a.  $\\displaystyle={\\frac{dQ}{dt} = -0.2 Q + 60}$\n    b.  We need to rewrite the differential equation as $\\displaystyle={\\frac{dQ}{dt} = -0.2 (Q - 300)}$. The solution is $Q(t) = 300 - 300 e^{-0.2t}$.\n    c.  $Q(t)$ converges to $300$\n\n### Elementary, My Dear Watson\n\nIn a mystery novel, the body of a murder victim is found at noon in a room with a constant temperature of $20^\\circ C$. At noon, the body is $35^\\circ C$ and at 2 pm the body is $33^\\circ C$. Normal body temperature is $37^\\circ C$. What time did the murder occur?\n\nWe use Newton's Law of Cooling $\\frac{dT}{dt} = r(T-A)$ where $A=20$. Let's set $t=0$ to be noon. We have $T(0)=35$ and $T(2)=33$. The initial condition tell us that the solution is $T(t) = 20 + 15e^{rt}$. Next, we have $T(2)  = 33 = 20 + 15e^{2r}$ and so $r = \\frac{1}{2} \\ln(13/15) = -0.072.$ Our temperature function is $T(t) = 20+15e^{-0.072t}.$\n\nFinally, we solve $37 = 20+15e^{-0.072t}$ which is equivalent to $17/15 = e^{-0.072t}$. Our time of death is $t= -1/(0.072) \\ln(17/15) = -1.74$. So the time of death was 10:15 am.\n\n### Optimal Coffee Temperature\n\nIn my $22^\\circ C$ office, my coffee starts at $80^\\circ C$, but cools to $75^\\circ C$ after 10 minutes. If I like my coffee between $63^\\circ C$ and $70^\\circ C$, how long is my window to drink it?\n\nWe have $T(t) = 22 + 58 e^{rt}$. Solving $75 = 22 + 58e^{10r}$ gives $r= \\frac{1}{10} \\ln (53/58) = -0.009$. The temperature formula is $22 + 68 e^{-0.009 t}$.\n\nNext, we solve $63 = 22 + 58 e^{-0.009 t}$ to find that $t= -1/0.009 \\ln(41/58)=38.54$. Finally we solve $70 = 22 + 58 e^{-0.009 t}$ to find that $t= -1/0.009 \\ln(48/58)=21.03$. So the coffee is drinkable from minute 21 to minute $38.5$.\n\n### Constrained Rabbit Population\n\nThe yearly population $P(t)$ of rabbits is modeled by $$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.45 P  \\left(1 - \\frac{P}{90} \\right).\n$$\n\n1.  We have $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.45 \\cdot 120  \\left(1 - \\frac{120}{90} \\right) < 0$. The population will decrease because the rate of change is negative.\n2.  $P'(t)=0$ when $P=0$ and when $P=90$.\n3.  The carrying capacity is 90.\n\n### Constrained Deer Population\n\nThe annual population $P(t)$ of deer is modeled by the constrained growth equation $$\n\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.22 P - 0.0275 P^2.\n$$\n\n1.  The growth rate is $r=0.23$.\n\n2.  We rewrite the derivative as $$\n    \\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.22 P\\left( 1 - \\frac{0.0275}{0.22} P \\right) = 0.22 P\\left( 1 - \\frac{P}{8} \\right)\n    $$ So the carrying capacity is $K=8$.\n\n3.  The rate of change is largest when $P=K/2=4$. The rate of change is $0.22 \\cdot 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} =  0.44$.\n\n</details>\n",
