The cost of each unit of $x$ is \\$5 and the cost of each unit of $y$ is \\$4.\n\n1.  Find the maximal output for a budget of \\$500, along with how much input $x$ and $y$ is used to create them. (Hint: plot your contour diagram on the domain $0 \\leq x \\leq 100$ and $0 \\leq y \\leq 100$. Start with the **default** contours by removing the `levels` input.)\n\n2.  What is the maximal output if the unit cost of $x$ increases to \\$7? How much of inputs $x$ and $y$ are used?\n\n3.  What is the maximal output if the unit cost of $x$ returns to \\$5 and the budget is decreased to \\$300? How much of inputs $x$ and $y$ are used?\n\n### Constrained Optimization on a Circle\n\nBelow is a plot of an objective function $f(x,y)$ in red, and its constraint function $g(x,y)=4$ in blue.\n\n1.  Estimate the **minimum** value of $f(x,y)$ constrained to $g(x,y)=4$. What point achieves this minimum?\n2.  Estimate the **maximum** value of $f(x,y)$ constrained to $g(x,y)=4$.

Here is our plot of the objective function $P(x,y)$ and the constraint $Q(x,y) = 500$.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nP = makeFun( x^(4/11) * y^(7/11) ~ x&y)\nQ = makeFun( 5*x + 4*y ~ x&y)\n\ncontour_plot(P(x,y)~x&y, domain(x=0:100, y=0:100), skip=0) |> \n  contour_plot(Q(x,y) ~ x & y, contour_color=\"black\", \n               contours_at=c(500), label_placement=.25)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](4D-ConstrainedOptimization_files/figure-html/constrained-opt-plot2 -1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe maximum output for our budget occurs where the $Q(x,y)=500$ constraint is tangent to a contour of $P(x,y)$. This occurs at (approximately) the point $(38,78)$ and we estimate that the maximum production is $P(38,78)=60$.\n\n2.  We need to make a new plot using an updated objective function.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nP = makeFun( x^(4/11) * y^(7/11) ~ x&y)\nQ = makeFun( 7*x + 4*y ~ x&y)\n\ncontour_plot(P(x,y)~x&y, domain(x=0:100, y=0:100), skip=0) |> \n  contour_plot(Q(x,y) ~ x & y, contour_color=\"black\", \n               contours_at=c(500), label_placement=.25)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](4D-ConstrainedOptimization_files/figure-html/constrained-opt-plot3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nNow, the constraint isn't tangent to any of the shown contours, but it IS tangent to a contour that we haven't drawn! That point is somewhere around (25, 80), and the optimal productions probably around 52 or so. Let's make another plot on a smaller domain and pick some contours to draw.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncontour_plot(P(x,y)~x&y, domain(x=0:50, y=50:100), skip=0, \n             contours_at = seq(23,73,5)) |> \n  contour_plot(Q(x,y) ~ x & y, contour_color=\"black\", \n               contours_at=c(500), label_placement=.25)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](4D-ConstrainedOptimization_files/figure-html/constrained-opt-plot4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAfter some experimentation, I realized that $P(x,y)=53$ is the contour that is tangent $Q(x,y)=500$. So the optimal point is $(26,80)$ and the optimal output is 53.\n\n3.  Now we return to the original constraint function, but decrease the budget to $300$.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nP = makeFun( x^(4/11) * y^(7/11) ~ x&y)\nQ = makeFun( 7*x + 4*y ~ x&y)\n\ncontour_plot(P(x,y)~x&y, domain(x=0:50, y=25:75), skip=0) |> \n  contour_plot(Q(x,y) ~ x & y, contour_color=\"black\", \n               contours_at=c(300), label_placement=.25)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](4D-ConstrainedOptimization_files/figure-html/constrained-opt-plot5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nThe optimal point is at $(21,40)$ and the optimal production is approximately $f(21,40)=32$.\n\n### Constrained Optimization on a Circle\n\n1.  The minimum is approximately $f(1.5, 1.5) = 20$.\n2.  The maximum is approximately $f(4.5, 4.5) = 210$.\n\n### Estimating the Lagrange Multiplier\n\n1.  For a budget of 15, the maximal production is $f(25,18)=250$.\n\n2.  For a budget of 20, the maximal production is $f(32,26)=360$.\n\n3.  The Lagrange multiplier is $$\n    \\lambda = \\frac{\\triangle \\mbox{production}}{\\triangle \\mbox{constraint}} \\approx \\frac{360-250}{20-15}=\\frac{110}{5}=22  \\frac{\\mbox{units}}{\\mbox{dollar}}\n    $$ So if we increase our budget by \\$1, then we will produce 22 more units.\n\n4.  The Lagrange multiplier is approximately $22$ units/dollar. We will break even if we can sell one unit for $1/22=0.045$ dollars/unit. So if the sale price is at least \\$0.045, we will decide to increase production.\n\n</details>\n",
