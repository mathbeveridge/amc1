Write a differential equation that models the change.\n\n1.  A population $P$ grows at a rate proportional to the size of the population.\n2.  Dead leaves $L$ accumulate on the ground at a rate of 3 grams per square centimeter per year. At the same time, the leaves decompose at a continuous rate of 75% per year.\n3.  The principal $P$ of a home mortgage increases at 5% a year and the annual payment is \\$10000.\n4.  Bacteria grow proportionally to the product of the current population $N$ and the difference between the carrying capacity $M$ and the current population $N$.\n\n### Solve the Differential Equation\n\nUse your knowledge of anti-derivatives to solve the following differential equations\n\n1.  $\\displaystyle{ \\frac{dy}{dx} = \\cos(2 \\pi x)}$\n2.  $\\displaystyle{ \\frac{ds}{dt} = a t + v}$ where $a$ and $v$ are constants.\n3.  $\\displaystyle{ \\frac{dP}{dq} = \\frac{100}{q}}$ where $P(1) = 200$.\n4.  $\\displaystyle{ \\frac{dy}{dx} = e^{-x}}$ where $P(2) = 0$.\n\n### Verifying Solutions to Differential Equations\n\nDetermine which of the following functions are solutions to the differential equation $$\n\\frac{dy}{dx} =3y.\n$$\n\n1.  $y=x^3$\n2.  $y=e^{3x}$\n3.  $y=\\sin(3x)+\\cos(3x)$\n4.  $y=0$\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n## Solutions\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click for Solutions</summary>\n\n\n\n### Building Differential Equations\n\n1.  $\\frac{dP}{dt} = r P$\n2.  $\\frac{dL}{dt} = 3 - 0.75L$\n3.  $\\frac{dP}{dt} = 0.05P - 10000$\n4.  $\\frac{dP}{dt} = k N (M-N)$\n\n### Solve the Differential Equation\n\nUse your knowledge of anti-derivatives to solve the following differential equations\n\n1.  $\\displaystyle{ y = \\frac{1}{2\\pi} \\sin(2\\pi x) + C}$\n2.  $\\displaystyle{ s = \\frac{1}{2}a t^2 + vt + C}$\n3.  $\\displaystyle{ P = 100 \\ln (q) + 200}$\n4.  $\\displaystyle{ y = -e^{-x} + e^{-2}}$.\n\n### Verifying Solutions to Differential Equations\n\nWe must check whether $\\frac{dy}{dx} =3y.$\n\n1.  $\\frac{dy}{dx}=3x^2$ and $3y=3x^3$. These are not equal, so $y=x^3$ is NOT a solution.\n2.  $\\frac{dy}{dx}=3e^{3x}$ and $3y = 3e^{3x}$. These are equal, so $y=e^{3x}$ is a solution!\n3.  $\\frac{dy}{dx}=3\\cos(3x)-3\\sin(3x)$ and $3y=3\\sin(3x)+3\\cos(3x)$. These are not equal (they differ by a negative sign), so $y=\\sin(3x)+\\cos(3x)$ is NOT a solution.\n4.  $\\frac{dy}{dx}=0$ and $3y=0$. These are equal, so $y=0$ is a solution!\n\n</details>",
