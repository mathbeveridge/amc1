When we start, the temperature of the solution is $80^\\circ$F, after 5 minutes it's $115^\\circ$F, and after 10 minutes it's $165^\\circ$F.\n\n1.  Estimate the temperature after 17 minutes.\n2.  The sugar solution needs to reach $289^\\circ$F to be the consistancy of taffy. Estimate when this will happen.\n\n### Comparing Linearizations\n\n1.  Draw two (nonlinear) functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ and their linearizations at $x=1$. One function should be \"well estimated\" by the linearization around $x=1$ and the other should be \"poorly estimated\" by the linearization around $x=1$.\n2.  What feature(s) of the curve $y=f(x)$ result in a good approximation?\n3.  What feature(s) of the curve $y=g(x)$ result in a bad approximation?\n\n### Estimating a Function\n\n1.  Find the linearization $L_2(x)$ the function $g(t)=t^3+e^t-4$.\n\n    -   Remember that $L_2(x)$ means \"the local linear approximation at $x=2$.\"\\\n    -   You will need to use desmos to approximate $f'(2)$.\n\n2.  Use your formula for $L_2(x)$ to estimate $g(2.1)$, $g(1.98)$, $g(3)$ and $g(0.7)$.\n\n3.  Check your estimations with the original function.\n\n4.  What do you notice about your approximations as you get further from the spot where you built the linearization?\n\n### Estimating the Windchill\n\nWe've talked about windchill $w(t,v)$ as a function of temperature $t$ and wind speed $v$. Here is the table that we've used\n\n![](images/wind-chill.png){width=\"100%\"}\n\n1.  The perceived temperature when $t=-10 ^\\circ$F and $v=40$ mph is $w(-10,40)=-43$. I have used desmos to estimate that $$\n    w_t(-10,-40) = 1.39, \\qquad w_v(-10,40)= âˆ’0.28.\n    $$ Use these values to find the linearization $L_{(-10,40)}(t,v)$ at the point $(-10,40)$.\n\n2.  Use your linearization (and desmos!) to estimate the four windchill values $w(-5,40)$, $w(-15,40)$, $w(-10,45)$ and $w(-10,35)$. Are your estimates close to the actual values?\n\n3.  Find the linearization of $w(t,v)$ at $t=-10$ and $v=40$ using the the partial derivatives of the formula $w(t,v) = 35.74+0.6215 t-35.75 v^{0.16}+0.4275 t \\, v^{0.16}$. Here is a [link to my desmos calculator for the partial derivatives of this function.](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/dvuhpknthj)\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n## Solutions\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click for Solutions</summary>\n\n### Estimating Sugar Solution Temperature\n\n1.  Let's use $f(t)$ to denote the temperature.We need to estimate the rate of change at $t=10$. We have $$ f'(10) \\approx \\frac{165 - 115}{10-5} = \\frac{50}{5}=10$$. We use the linear approximation $$L_{10}(t) = 165 + 10 (t-10)$$ to estimate the temperature. We have $$f(17) \\approx L_{10}(17) = 165 + 10 (17-10) = 235.$$\n\n2.  We must solve $$ 289 = 165 + 10 (t-10) = 65t$$ to find that $10t = 224$ and so $t=22.4$ minutes.\n\n### Comparing Linearizations\n\n1.  In the graph below, the blue function is well estimated by its tangent line, while the red function is not.\n\n![](images/linear-approx.png){width=\"60%\"}\n\n2.  If the curve has low concavity near the point $x=a$ then the tangent line is a good approximation. In other words, the second derivative remains near zero around the point $x=a$\n3.  If the curve has a lot of concavity near the point $x=a$ then then tangent line is not a good approximation. This is because the curve bends away from the tangent line.\n\n### Estimating a Function\n\n1.  Using desmos, I found that $f(2)=11.39$ and $f'(2)=19.39$. Therefore $$ L_2(t) = 11.39 + 19.39 ( t-2).$$\n\n2.  I get the estimates $g(2.1) \\approx 13.33$, $g(1.98) \\approx 11.00$, $g(3) \\approx 30.78$ and $g(0.7) \\approx -13.82$.\n\n3.  The true values are $g(2.1) = 13.43$, $g(1.98) = 11.01$, $g(3) = 43.09$ and $g(0.7) \\approx -1.64$..\n\n4.  The approximations close to $t=2$ are much better!\n\n### Estimating the Windchill\n\n1.  $L_{(-10,40)}(t,v) = -43 + 1.39(t+10) -0.24(v-40)$\n\n2.  My estimates are $w(-5,40) \\approx -36.05$, $w(-15,40) \\approx -49.95$, $w(-10,45) \\approx 41.8$ and $w(-10,35) \\approx -44.2$. These are pretty close to the values on the table.\n\n3.  Using the function and the partial derivatives from [this desmos calculation](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/dvuhpknthj), we get $$\n    L_{(-10,40)}(t,v) = -42.70 + 1.39(t+10) -0.29(v-40)\n    $$\n\n</details>\n",
