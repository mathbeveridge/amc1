We have three different functions\n\n-   $f(x) = x^3$ has no extrema\n-   $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2+1}$ has a global maximum at $x=1$\n-   $f(x) = \\cos(x)$ has global maxima at $x=2k \\pi$ for every integer $k$. It has global minima at $x=(2k+1) \\pi$ for every integer $k$.\n\n2.  Once again we have three functions\n\n-   LEFT: global maximum at $x=0$; local maximum at $x=4$. Note that $x=2$ is not a local minimum.\n-   MIDDLE: local maximum at $x=1$; global minimum at $x=2$; global maximum at $x=4$.\n-   RIGHT: global minimum at $x=0$. Note that $x=2$ is not a global maximum (because the function is not defined at $x=2$).\n\n### First Derivative Test\n\nFind the critical point(s) of the following functions. Then use the first derivative test to determine whether it is a local minimum, a local maximum, or neither\n\n1.  We have $f(x) = x - e^x$ and so $f'(x) = 1 - e^x$. There is one critical point: $$\n    \\begin{array}{rcl}\n    1-e^x &=& 0 \\\\\n    e^x &=& 1 \\\\\n    x &=& 0.\n    \\end{array}\n    $$ Using the first derivative test, we have $f'(-1) = 1 - e^{-1} > 0$ and $f'(1) = 1 - e < 0$. Therefore $x=0$ is a local maximum.\n\n2.  We have $g(x) = x + \\sin(x)$ and therefore $g'(x) = 1 + \\sin(x)$. There is one critical point: $$\n    \\begin{array}{rcl}\n    1 + \\cos(x) &=& 0 \\\\\n    \\cos(x) &=& -1 \\\\\n    x &=& \\pi\n    \\end{array}\n    $$\n\nWe have $g'(\\pi/2) = 1 > 0$ and $g'(3 \\pi/2) = 1 > 0$. (In fact, $1+\\cos(x)$ is never negative) Therefore this point is not an extremum.\n\nTo find all the extrema of $g(x)$, we need to consider the endpoints of $[0,2\\pi]$. The function never decreases as we move from $0$ to $2\\pi$.So $x=0$ is the global minimum, and $x=2\\pi$ is the global maximum.\n\n### Second Derivative Test\n\nThe function $f(x) = x^4-8 x^3+22 x^2-24 x$ has critical points at $x=1$ and $x=2$ and $x=3$.\n\n1.  We have $$f'(x) = 4x^3 - 24 x^2 + 44 x - 24$$ and $$ f''(x) = 12x^2 - 48x + 44.$$\n2.  We check the critical points $x=1$, $x=2$ and $x=3$. $$\n    \\begin{array}{rcl}\n    f''(1) &=& 12 - 48 + 44 = 8 > 0 \\\\\n    f''(2) &=& 48 - 96 + 44 = -2 < 0 \\\\\n    f''(3) &=& 108 - 144 + 44 > 0 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    $$\n\nTherefore $x=1$ and $x=3$ are local minima and $x=2$ is a local maximum.\n\n### Cupcake Store\n\n\nA cupcake store finds that at a price of \\$4.00, the demand is 400 cupcakes. For every $1 increase in price, the demand decreases by 80 cupcakes. \n\n1. The revenue function is\n$$r(x) = (4+x)(400-80x) = 1600 + 80x - 80x^2.$$ \n\n\n2. To find the price and quantity that maximize the revenue, we set the derivative equal to 0. This gives\n$$\nr'(x) = 80 - 160x = 0\n$$\nand solving gives\n$$\nx=1/2.\n$$\nFurthermore, the second derivative is $r''(x) = -160 < 0$ so this point is a maximum.\n\nThe optimal price is \\$4.50 and the maximal revenue is\n$$\nr(1/2)= 1600 + 40 - 20 = 1620.\n$$\n\n\n</details>\n",
