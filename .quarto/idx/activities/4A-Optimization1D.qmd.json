Find the price and quantity that maximize the revenue.\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n## Solutions\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click for Solutions</summary>\n\n### Characterize the Extrema\n\n1.  We have three different functions\n\n-   $f(x) = x^3$ has no extrema\n-   $f(x) = \\frac{1}{x^2+1}$ has a global maximum at $x=1$\n-   $f(x) = \\cos(x)$ has global maxima at $x=2k \\pi$ for every integer $k$. It has global minima at $x=(2k+1) \\pi$ for every integer $k$.\n\n2.  Once again we have three functions\n\n-   LEFT: global maximum at $x=0$; local maximum at $x=4$. Note that $x=2$ is not a local minimum.\n-   MIDDLE: local maximum at $x=1$; global minimum at $x=2$; global maximum at $x=4$.\n-   RIGHT: global minimum at $x=0$. Note that $x=2$ is not a global maximum (because the function is not defined at $x=2$).\n\n### First Derivative Test\n\nFind the critical point(s) of the following functions. Then use the first derivative test to determine whether it is a local minimum, a local maximum, or neither\n\n1. We have $f(x) = x^4 + 8 x^3 + 16 x^2$ and so\n$f'(x)=4x^3+24x^2+32x$. We can factor this as\n$$\nf'(x) = 4x(x^2+6x+8) = 4x(x+2)(x+4).\n$$\nThere are three critical points: $x=0$ and $x=-2$ and $x=-4$. The first derivative test gives the diagram:\n\n````{verbatim}\n   -      +        -       +\n-------o-------o-------o--------\n      -4      -2       0\n\n````\nSo $-4$ is a local minimum, $-2$ is a local maximum, and $0$ is a local minimum.\n\n2.  We have $g(x) = x - e^x$ and so $g'(x) = 1 - e^x$. There is one critical point: $$\n    \\begin{array}{rcl}\n    1-e^x &=& 0 \\\\\n    e^x &=& 1 \\\\\n    x &=& 0.\n    \\end{array}\n    $$ Using the first derivative test, we have $g'(-1) = 1 - e^{-1} > 0$ and $g'(1) = 1 - e < 0$. This leads to the first derivative diagram:\n\n````{verbatim}\n   +       -\n-------o-------\n       0     \n````    \n    \n  Therefore $x=0$ is a local maximum.\n\n3.  We have $h(x) = x + \\sin(x)$ and therefore $h'(x) = 1 + \\sin(x)$. There is one critical point: $$\n    \\begin{array}{rcl}\n    1 + \\cos(x) &=& 0 \\\\\n    \\cos(x) &=& -1 \\\\\n    x &=& \\pi\n    \\end{array}\n    $$\n\nWe have $h'(\\pi/2) = 1 > 0$ and $h'(3 \\pi/2) = 1 > 0$. (In fact, $1+\\cos(x)$ is never negative.) This leads to the first derivative diagram:\n\n````{verbatim}\n   +       +\n-------o-------\n      pi/2     \n````\n\nTherefore the point $x=\\pi/2$ is not an extremum.\n\nTo find all the extrema of $h(x)$, we need to consider the endpoints of $[0,2\\pi]$. The function never decreases as we move from $0$ to $2\\pi$.So $x=0$ is the global minimum, and $x=2\\pi$ is the global maximum.\n\n### Visual First Derivative Test\n\n1. There are two local minima.\n\n  - The endpoint $x=0$ is a local minimum because the function increases after leaving this point.\n  - The point $x=6$ is a local minimum because the derivative changes from negative to positive at this point.\n\n2. There are two local maxima.\n\n  - The point $x=1$ is a local maximum because the derivative changes from positive to negative at this point.\n  - The endpoint $x=7$ is a local maximum because the function increases up to this point.\n\n3. The points of inflection occur at the local minima and local maxima of this derivative function $f'(x)$. These occur at the points $x=1.6$ and $x=3$ and $x=5.2$\n\n\n\n### Second Derivative Test\n\nThe function $f(x) = x^4-8 x^3+22 x^2-24 x$ has critical points at $x=1$ and $x=2$ and $x=3$.\n\n1.  We have $$f'(x) = 4x^3 - 24 x^2 + 44 x - 24$$ and $$ f''(x) = 12x^2 - 48x + 44.$$\n2.  We check the critical points $x=1$, $x=2$ and $x=3$. $$\n    \\begin{array}{rcl}\n    f''(1) &=& 12 - 48 + 44 = 8 > 0 \\\\\n    f''(2) &=& 48 - 96 + 44 = -2 < 0 \\\\\n    f''(3) &=& 108 - 144 + 44 > 0 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    $$\n\nTherefore $x=1$ and $x=3$ are local minima and $x=2$ is a local maximum.\n\n### Second Derivative Test 2\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = 2x^5 - 5x^2 + 10$.\n\n1. We have $f'(x)=10x^4 - 10x = 10x(x^3 -1)$. The critical points are $x=0$ and $x=1$.\n\n2. We have $f''(x)= 40x^3 - 10$. Considering $x=0$, we have $f''(0) = -10 < 0$, so $x=0$ is a local maximum. As for $x=1$, we have $f''(1) = 30 > 0$, so $x=1$ is a local minimum.\n\n### Fenced Garden Design\n\n1. There are 3 horizontal fences of length $x$ and $4$ vertical fences of length $y$. So the total length of the fences satisfies\n$$\n1200 = 3x + 4y.\n$$\n2. Solving the equation in part 1 for $y$ gives\n$$\ny = 300 - \\frac{3}{4} x.\n$$\nTherefore the formula for the area is\n$$\nA(x) = x \\left(300 - \\frac{3}{4} x \\right) = 300x - \\frac{3}{4}x^2.\n$$\n\n3. The derivative of the area is\n$$\nA'(x) = 300 - \\frac{3}{2}x.\n$$\nSetting this equal to zero and solving gives $x=200$.\nThe second derivative of the area is\n$$\nA''(x) = - \\frac{3}{2} < 0\n$$\nSo this critical point is a local maximum by the second derivative test.\n\n4. We have $x=200$ and therefore $y=300 - 600/4 = 300-150=150.$ So the total area of the garden is\n$$\n200 \\cdot 150 = 30,000 \\mbox{ ft}^2\n$$\n\n\n### Cupcake Store\n\n\nA cupcake store finds that at a price of \\$4.00, the demand is 400 cupcakes. For every $1 increase in price, the demand decreases by 80 cupcakes. \n\n1. The revenue function is\n$$r(x) = (4+x)(400-80x) = 1600 + 80x - 80x^2.$$ \n\n\n2. To find the price and quantity that maximize the revenue, we set the derivative equal to 0. This gives\n$$\nr'(x) = 80 - 160x = 0\n$$\nand solving gives\n$$\nx=1/2.\n$$\nFurthermore, the second derivative is $r''(x) = -160 < 0$ so this point is a maximum.\n\nThe optimal price is \\$4.50 and the maximal revenue is\n$$\nr(1/2)= 1600 + 40 - 20 = 1620.\n$$\n\n\n</details>\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"4A-Optimization1D.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
