Its brightness (as seen from Earth) fluctuates as it expands and contracts. The apparent magnitude ranges from a maximum of 10th magnitude to a minimum of 2nd magnitude. This apparent brightness has a period of 332 days.\n\nFind a formula that models the brightness of Mira as a function of time, with $t=0$ at peak brightness.\n\n### Tides and currents\n\nHere is a plot of the water level (in red) and the current speed (in blue) of the St. Johns River. Each of them go through two cycles in 24.83 hours. This is the length of one **lunar day**: the time it takes for a point on the Earth to rotate from an exact point under the Moon to that same point under the Moon. (This is slightly longer than one day because the Moon revolves around the Earth in the same direction as the Earth's rotation.) So you can assume that the period for each is 12.415 hours.\n\nModel the water level $w(t)$ and the current speed $c(t)$ using periodic functions, where $t$ is the number of hours since midnight April 28, 1998.\n\n-   Be sure to use the appropriate vertical axis for each one!\n-   Decide which one will be easier to model: $w(t)$ or $c(t)$? Do that one first, and then adjust that function to get the other one.\n\n![](images/tidevscurrentstjohns.jpeg){width=\"80%\"}\n\nImage Source: https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/\n\n<!--   actually take 25 hour cycle!!!

How about:\n\n-   The average monthly temperature in St Paul. The period of this function is one year, and it looks a lot like a sine function.\n-   The traffic on I-94. The period of this function is one week.\n-   The number of students in our classrrom. The period of this function is one week.\n-   The percentage of the moon that is illuminated. The period of this function is one lunar month.\n\n### Find a periodic formula\n\n1.  Here's the steps to find the function.\n\n- The max value is 3 and the min value is 1. So we have\n$$\nA = \\frac{\\max - \\min}{2} = \\frac{3-1}{2} = \\frac{2}{2}=1\n$$\nand\n$$\nC = \\frac{\\max + \\min}{2} = \\frac{3+1}{2} = \\frac{4}{2} = 2. \n$$\n- The easiest way to find the period is to look for identifiable points. We reach the minimum at $x=-\\pi$ and $x = \\pi$, and we go through 3 cycles between them. So\n$$\nT = \\frac{\\pi - (-\\pi)}{3} = \\frac{2 \\pi}{3}\n$$\nwhich means that\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{2 \\pi/3} = 3.\n$$\n\n- Now we need to choose a function from $\\sin$, $-\\sin$, $\\cos$ and $\\cos$. Hopefully we can pick one that will let us take $\\phi=0$. Looking at the function, we see that it reaches a maximum at $x=0$, which is compatible with $\\cos$.\n\nTherefore, the function is \n$$\n\\cos\\left(3x \\right)+2\n$$\n\n2.  Here's the steps to find the function.\n\n- The center line is 0, so $C=0$.\n- The max value is 7 and the min value is -7. So we have\n$$\nA = \\frac{\\max - \\min}{2} = \\frac{7 - (-7)}{2} = \\frac{14}{2}=7.\n$$\n\n- The easiest way to find the period is to look for identifiable points. We begin a cycle at at $x=0$ and start the next new cycle at $x = 3$. So\n$$\nT = 3 - 0 = 3\n$$\nwhich means that\n$$\n\\omega = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}.\n$$\n\n- Now we need to choose a function from $\\sin$, $-\\sin$, $\\cos$ and $\\cos$. Hopefully we can pick one that will let us take $\\phi=0$. Looking at the function, we see that it starts a cycle $x=0$, but is decreasing, and this compatible with $-\\sin$.\n\nTherefore, the function is \n$$\n-7 \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{3} x \\right).\n$$\n\n### Variable star\n\nThe amplitude is $(10-2)/2=4$ and the vertical shift is $(10+2)/2=6$. The period is 332 days, so our formula is $$ 4 \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi}{335} t\\right).$$\n\n### Tides and currents\n\nThe current speed uses the vertical axis on the left. The maximum is 3 and the minimum is -3. So the amplitude is 3 and there is no vertical shift. The maximuum is achieved at $t=0$, so we can just use a cosine curve: $$\nc(t) = 3 \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi}{12.415} t \\right)\n$$\n\nThe water level is modeled by a cosine curve *shifted to the right*. The water level has amplitude $(5.5 - (-0.5))/2) = 6/2=3$ and vertical shift $(5.5 + (-0.5))/2) = 3$. The period is $12.415$ hours, and we must shift to the right by one fourth of that amount, so $\\phi=-12.415/4 \\approx  -3.1$. So $$ w(t) = 3 \\cos \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi}{12.415} ( t - 3.1) \\right)  +3$$\n\n### Rainfall in Seattle\n\nThe amplitude is about $5/2=2.5$ and the vertical shift is $7/2=3.5$. The period is 12 months. We reach our peak in December, so we must shift a cosine curve to the left by $\\phi=1$ unit. So our function is $$ r(t) = 2.5 \\cos \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{12} ( t + 1) \\right) + 3.5.$$\n\n</details>\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"1F-Periodic.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
