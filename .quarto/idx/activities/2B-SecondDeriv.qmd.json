For each one, (a) determine whether the first derivative is positive, negative or zero and (b) determine whether the second derivative is positive, negative or zero.\n\n1.  The number of views of a video that is going viral.\n2.  The altitude of a bird that is about to have a gentle landing on the ground.\n3.  The location of a car that is cruising at the speed limit on a straight highway.\n\n## Solutions\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click for Solutions</summary>\n\n### Estimating the first and second derivatives from a graph\n\n1.  The first derivative is positive when the function is increasing. The first derivative is negative when the function is decreasing.\n\n-   $f'(x)>0$ on $[0,0.4]$ and $[1.4,2.3]$\n-   $f'(x)<0$ on $[0.4,1.4]$ and $[2.3,3]$\n\n2.  The second derivative is positive when the function is concave up. The second derivative is negative when the function is concave down.\n\n-   $f''(x)>0$ on $[0.9,1.75]$\n-   $f''(x)<0$ on $[0,0.9]$ and $[1.75,3]$\n\n\n### Sketch the Curve\n\nHere are the derivative curves for the given curves.\n\n1. Here is one example where we have\n\n  - $f'(x) < 0$ for all $x$.\n  - $f''(x) < 0$ for $x < 4$,\n  - $f''(x) > 0$ for $x > 4$.\n\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}\nslice_plot(2*cos(pi* x/8)+1 ~ x, domain(x=0:8), color='blue')\n```\n\n2. Here is one example where we have\n\n  - $f'(x) < 0$ for $x < 3$,\n  - $f'(x) > 0$ for $x > 3$,\n  - $f''(x) > 0$ for $x < 6$,\n  - $f''(x) < 0$ for $x > 6$ \n\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}\nslice_plot(- sin(pi/6 * (x)) ~ x, domain(x=0:8), color='blue') \n```\n\n\n### Function Matching\n\nThe function $g(x)$ is the derivative of $f(x)$. This is because $f(x)$ is increasing if and only if $g(x)$ is positive.\n\nSimilarly, the function $h(x)$ is the derivative of $g(x)$.\n\nSo we have $g(x)=f'(x)$ and $h(x) = f''(x)$.\n\n\n### A Plot of Velocity\n\n1.  Since the plot shows **velocity**, its derivative is the **acceleration**. So we have positive acceleration when the graph is increasing. This is true on $[0,0.6]$ and $[1.55,2]$.\n2.  The position of the object is increasing whenever the velocity is positive. The graph is above the $x$-axis on $[0,0.9]$.\n\n### Characterize the Derivatives\n\n1.  Both the first and second derivatives are positive. The number of views is increasing at a faster and faster rate.\n2.  The first derivative is negative because the height of the bird is decreasing. The second derivative is positive because the bird is slowing down as it approaches the ground.\n3.  The first derivative is positive since the car is moving forward. The second derivative is zero because the velocity is not changing.\n\n</details>\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"2B-SecondDeriv.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
