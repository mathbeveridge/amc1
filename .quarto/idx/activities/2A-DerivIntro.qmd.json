Calculate the derivative, give the units, and give an interpretation of the number you get.\n2.  Is this rate of change constant? Explain.\n\n### Marginal Cost\n\nEconomists use the term \"marginal cost\" for the derivative of the cost of production. Here is the definition:\n\n\\bigskip\n\nThe **marginal cost** is the cost to produce 1 additional good.\n\n\\bigskip\n\nSuppose that it costs \\$250,000 to produce $i=1000$ iPhones.\n\n1.  If it costs \\$250,440 to produce 1002 iPhones, what's the marginal cost of 1 iPhone when $i=1000$?\n2.  Using the marginal cost from part 1, estimate how much it will cost to produce 1030 iPhones.\n\n### Farmland in the United States\n\nThe total acreage of farmland has been shrinking in the United States since 1980.\n\n| Year                         | 1980 | 1985 | 1990 | 1995 | 2000 |\n|------------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|\n| Farmland (millions of acres) | 1039 | 1012 | 987  | 963  | 945  |\n\n1.  Let $F(t)$ denote the amount of farmland at a time $t$. Use the data to estimate $F'(1995)$, the derivative at $t=1995$.\n2.  Did you use 1990 or 2000 as your estmation point? Did it matter? What does that mean?\n3.  You got a negative number for $F'(1995)$. Does that make sense with the situation? Why?\n4.  Give an example of a year that, if you had the data for it, would better help us estimate $F'(1995)$. Why?\n\n### A Moving Particle\n\nA particle's position over time is given by the formula $$\ns(t)=2+3\\sin(4t)+1.2t^2\n$$\n\n1.  Find the velocity at $t=1$ and $t=2$ numerically (using small subintervals). Remember that the velocity is the derivative of the position.\n2.  Use desmos to graph the position curve $s(t)$ and the tangent lines at both $t=1$ and $t=2$.\n\n\n\n### Sketch the derivative\n\nFor each of the following functions, sketch the graph of the derivative \n\n\n1.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}\nslice_plot(-3*x+6 ~ x, domain(x=0:3), color='blue')\n```\n\n\n2.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}\nslice_plot(-sin(x) ~ x, domain(x=0:2*pi), color='blue')\n```\n\n3.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}\nslice_plot(-(x-2)^2+8 ~ x, domain(x=-2:6), color='blue')\n```\n\n\n4.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}\nslice_plot((x-1)*(x-2)*(x-3) ~ x, domain(x=0:4), color='blue')\n```\n\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\n\n## Solutions\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click for Solutions</summary>\n\n### Studying\n\nSuppose that spending 3 extra hours on studying increases our percent grade on an exam by 14 percent.\n\n1.  The derivative is $\\frac{14}{3} = 4.67$ percent per hour. The interpretation: for every hour that you spend studying, your grade increases by $4.67\\%$.\n2.  This rate of change is not constant. After studying for a while, you reach \"burn out\", or perhaps you run out of new material to master. In addition, your grade tops out at 100%, so we cannot increase forever.\n\n### Marginal Cost\n\n1.  The marginal cost is $$ \n    \\frac{250,440 - 250,000}{102-100}=\\frac{440}{2} =220 \\mbox{ dollars per phone}\n    $$\n\n2.  I estimate that the cost of making 1030 phones is $$\n    250,000 + 200 \\cdot 30 = 256,600.\n    $$\n\n### Farmland in the United States\n\n1.  When estimating the derivative, we need to \"stay local\" in order to get the most reliable estimate. There are three equally good choices here: $$\n    \\begin{array}{rcl}\n    f'(1995) &\\approx& \\frac{f(2000)-f(1995)}{2000-1995}=\\frac{945-963}{5} = - \\frac{18}{5} = -3.6 \\\\\n    f'(1995) &\\approx& \\frac{f(1995)-f(1990)}{1995-1990}=\\frac{963-987}{5} = - \\frac{24}{5} = -4.8 \\\\\n    f'(1995) &\\approx& \\frac{f(2000)-f(1990)}{2000-1990}=\\frac{945-987}{10} = - \\frac{42}{10} = -4.2 \\\\\n    \\end{array}\n    $$\n\n2.  Any of the three estimates are good answers. Since we are estimating there isn't a \"right answer.\" All three stay close to 1995, so each one is good.\n\n3.  We got a negative number because the acreage is decreasing.\n\n4.  If we had the data for 1994 or 1996, using these values would give us a better estimate. Using smaller and smaller intervals will give us a more accurate estimation. (But we cannot tell up front how \"small\" we need to be to get the accurracy we desire.)\n\n### A Moving Particle\n\n1.  Using desmos, we know that $$\n    s'(1) \\approx \\frac{s(1+h)-s(1)}{h} \\approx -5.44\n    $$ when $0 < h < 0.00001$. Similarly, we have $$\n    s'(1) \\approx \\frac{s(2+h)-s(2)}{h} \\approx 5.03\n    $$ when $0 < h < 0.00001$.\n\n2.  Here are the commands to plot the curve and the two tangent lines.\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{l}\ns\\left(t\\right)=2+3\\sin(4t)+1.2t^{2} \\\\\n\\\\\ny = -5.44(t-1) + s(1) \\\\\n\\\\\ny = 5.03(t-2) + s(2) \\\\\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\n\n### Sketch the derivative\n\nHere are the derivative curves for the given curves.\n\n\n1.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}\nslice_plot(-3 ~ x, domain(x=0:3), color='blue')\n```\n\n\n2.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4, fig.height=3}\nslice_plot(-cos(x) ~ x, domain(x=0:2*pi), color='blue')\n```\n\n3.\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=4,
