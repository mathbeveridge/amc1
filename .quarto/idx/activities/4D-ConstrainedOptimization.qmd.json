The cost of each unit of $x$ is \\$5 and the cost of each unit of $y$ is \\$4.\n\n1.  Find the maximal output for a budget of \\$500, along with how much input $x$ and $y$ is used to create them. (Hint: plot your contour diagram on the domain $0 \\leq x \\leq 100$ and $0 \\leq y \\leq 100$. Start with the **default** contours by removing the `levels` input.)\n\n2.  What is the maximal output if the unit cost of $x$ increases to \\$7? How much of inputs $x$ and $y$ are used?\n\n3.  What is the maximal output if the unit cost of $x$ returns to \\$5 and the budget is decreased to \\$300? How much of inputs $x$ and $y$ are used?\n\n### Constrained Optimization on a Circle\n\nBelow is a plot of an objective function $f(x,y)$ in red, and its constraint function $g(x,y)=4$ in blue.\n\n1.

(Hint: the units for your answer are \"dollars per unit produced.\")\n\n## Solutions\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Click for Solutions</summary>\n\n### Constrained Production\n\n1.  Here is our plot of the objective function $P(x,y)$ and the constraint $Q(x,y) = 500$.\n\n```{r constrained-opt-plot2 , message=FALSE}\n\nP = makeFun( x^(4/11) * y^(7/11) ~ x&y)\nQ = makeFun( 5*x + 4*y ~ x&y)\n\ncontour_plot(P(x,y)~x&y, domain(x=0:100, y=0:100), skip=0) |> \n  contour_plot(Q(x,y) ~ x & y, contour_color=\"black\", \n               contours_at=c(500), label_placement=.25)\n\n```\n\nThe maximum output for our budget occurs where the $Q(x,y)=500$ constraint is tangent to a contour of $P(x,y)$. This occurs at (approximately) the point $(38,78)$ and we estimate that the maximum production is $P(38,78)=60$.\n\n2.  We need to make a new plot using an updated objective function.\n\n```{r constrained-opt-plot3, message=FALSE}\n\nP = makeFun( x^(4/11) * y^(7/11) ~ x&y)\nQ = makeFun( 7*x + 4*y ~ x&y)\n\ncontour_plot(P(x,y)~x&y, domain(x=0:100, y=0:100), skip=0) |> \n  contour_plot(Q(x,y) ~ x & y, contour_color=\"black\", \n               contours_at=c(500), label_placement=.25)\n\n```\n\nNow, the constraint isn't tangent to any of the shown contours, but it IS tangent to a contour that we haven't drawn! That point is somewhere around (25, 80), and the optimal productions probably around 52 or so. Let's make another plot on a smaller domain and pick some contours to draw.\n\n```{r constrained-opt-plot4, message=FALSE}\ncontour_plot(P(x,y)~x&y, domain(x=0:50, y=50:100), skip=0, \n             contours_at = seq(23,73,5)) |> \n  contour_plot(Q(x,y) ~ x & y, contour_color=\"black\", \n               contours_at=c(500), label_placement=.25)\n```\n\nAfter some experimentation, I realized that $P(x,y)=53$ is the contour that is tangent $Q(x,y)=500$. So the optimal point is $(26,80)$ and the optimal output is 53.\n\n3.  Now we return to the original constraint function, but decrease the budget to $300$.\n\n```{r constrained-opt-plot5, message=FALSE}\n\nP = makeFun( x^(4/11) * y^(7/11) ~ x&y)\nQ = makeFun( 7*x + 4*y ~ x&y)\n\ncontour_plot(P(x,y)~x&y, domain(x=0:50, y=25:75), skip=0) |> \n  contour_plot(Q(x,y) ~ x & y, contour_color=\"black\", \n               contours_at=c(300), label_placement=.25)\n```\n\nThe optimal point is at $(21,40)$ and the optimal production is approximately $f(21,40)=32$.\n\n### Constrained Optimization on a Circle\n\n1.  The minimum is approximately $f(1.5, 1.5) = 20$.\n2.  The maximum is approximately $f(4.5, 4.5) = 210$.\n\n### Estimating the Lagrange Multiplier\n\n1.  For a budget of 15, the maximal production is $f(25,18)=250$.\n\n2.  For a budget of 20, the maximal production is $f(32,26)=360$.\n\n3.  The Lagrange multiplier is $$\n    \\lambda = \\frac{\\triangle \\mbox{production}}{\\triangle \\mbox{constraint}} \\approx \\frac{360-250}{20-15}=\\frac{110}{5}=22  \\frac{\\mbox{units}}{\\mbox{dollar}}\n    $$ So if we increase our budget by \\$1, then we will produce 22 more units.\n\n4.  The Lagrange multiplier is approximately $22$ units/dollar. We will break even if we can sell one unit for $1/22=0.045$ dollars/unit. So if the sale price is at least \\$0.045, we will decide to increase production.\n\n</details>\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"4D-ConstrainedOptimization.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
