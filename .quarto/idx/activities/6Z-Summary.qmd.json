whether a given function is a solution to a given differential equation.\n-   Solve a simple differential equation of the form $\\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)$ using antiderivatives.\n-   Explain why a differential equation has an infinite family of solutions.\n-   Use an initial condition to turn a general solution into the unique solution to the differential equation.\n-   Create a differential equation to model a written description of the rate of change.\n\n## Population Models\n\nI can ...\n\n-   Solve the differential equation $\\frac{dP}{dt} = rP$ using $P(t)=Ce^{rt}$.\n-   Solve the differential equation $\\frac{dP}{dt} = r(P-A)$ using $P(t)=A+Ce^{rt}$.\n-   Solve the differential equation $\\frac{dP}{dt} = rP\\left( 1- \\frac{P}{K}\\right)$ using the logistic function $P(t)=\\frac{K}{1+Ce^{-rt}}$.\n-   Find the constant $C$ in each of the above functions using an initial condition.\n-   Solve a problem using Newton's Law of Heating and Cooling.\n\n## Euler's Method\n\nI can ...\n\n-   Explain what Euler's Method is, and why we must use numerical approximation to solve many differential equations.\n-   Manually perform a few steps of Euler's Method.\n-   Use RStudio to find an Euler's Method solution to a differential equation with initial conditions.\n\n## Slope Fields\n\n-   Explain what a slope field is.\n-   Draw trajectories on a slope field and describe the dynamics of those solution curves.\n-   Use a slope field to determine the long-term behavior of a solution curve.\n-   Match a slope field to its differential equation.\n\n## SIR Model\n\n-   Describe the Susceptible-Infected-Removed model for the spread of disease.\n-   Explain the various terms in the differential equations of the SIR model.\n-   Define the infection rate $a$ and the removal rate $b$.\n-   Create an SIR slope field using RStudio, and interpret what I see.\n-   Create an SIR trajectory plot using RStudio, and interpret what I see.\n-   Explain what the epidemic phase of a disease outbreak is\n-   Identify the threshold population by looking at an SIR slope field, looking at an SIR trajectory, or calculating $b/a$ in the SIR differential equations\n-   Describe the effect of various actions to mitigate the spread of disease, and how that changes the SIR Model.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"6Z-Summary.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
