{"title":"Learning Goals","markdown":{"headingText":"Learning Goals","headingAttr":{"id":"","classes":["unnumbered"],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThe goal of this course is for you to gain confidence in carrying out the entire data science pipeline,\n\n-   from research question formulation,\n-   to data collection/scraping,\n-   to wrangling,\n-   to modeling (covered in STAT 155, STAT 253, STAT 4xx courses),\n-   to visualization,\n-   to presentation and communication\n\nSpecific course topics and general skills are listed below.\n\n## General Skills {.unnumbered}\n\n**Data Communication**\n\n-   In written and oral formats:\n\n    -   Inform and justify data cleaning and analysis process and the resulting conclusions with clear, organized, logical, and compelling details that adapt to the background, values, and motivations of the audience and context in which communication occurs.\n\n**Collaborative Learning**\n\n-   Understand and demonstrate characteristics of effective collaboration (team roles, interpersonal communication, self-reflection, awareness of social dynamics, advocating for yourself and others).\n-   Develop a common purpose and agreement on goals.\n-   Be able to contribute questions or concerns in a respectful way.\n-   Share and contribute to the group's learning in an equitable manner.\n-   Develop a familiarity and comfort in using collaboration tools such as Git and Github.\n\n## Course Topics {.unnumbered}\n\nSpecific learning objectives for our course topics are listed below. Use these to guide your synthesis of course material for specific topics. Note that the topics are covered in the order of the **data science pipeline**, not the order in which we will cover them in class.\n\n### Foundation {.unnumbered}\n\n**Intro to R, RStudio, and R Markdown**\n\n-   Download and install the necessary tools (R, RStudio)\n-   Develop comfort in navigating the tools in RStudio\n-   Develop comfort in writing and knitting a R Markdown file\n-   Identify the characteristics of tidy data\n-   Use R code: as a calculator and to explore tidy data\n\n<br>\n\n### Data Visualization {.unnumbered}\n\n*The learning goals may be adjusted before we start the material of this section.*\n\n**Introduction to Data Visualization**\n\n-   Convince ourselves about the importance of data viz.\n-   Understand the \"grammar of graphics\"\n-   Use `ggplot2` functions to create data viz in RStudio\n-   Understand the different basic univariate visualizations for categorical and quantitative variables\n\n<br>\n\n**Bivariate**\n\n-   Identify appropriate types of bivariate visualizations to visualize relationships between 2 variables, depending on the type of variables (categorical, quantitative)\n-   Create basic bivariate visualizations based on real data with `ggplot2` functions in RStudio\n\n<br>\n\n**Multivariate**\n\n-   Understand how to visualize relationships between more than 2 variables.\n-   Add aesthetics such as color and size to incorporate a third (or more variables) to a bivariate plot with `ggplot2` functions in RStudio\n\n<br>\n\n**Spatial**\n\n-   Plot data points on top of a map using the (`ggplot()`)\n-   Create choropleth maps (`geom_map()`)\\\n-   Understand the basics of creating a map using `leaflet`, including adding points and choropleths to a base map.\n\n<br>\n\n**Effective Visualization**\n\n-   Understand and apply the guiding principles of effective visualizations\n\n<br>\n\n### Data Wrangling {.unnumbered}\n\n**Wrangling Verbs**\n\n-   Understand and be able to use the following verbs appropriately: `select`, `mutate`, `filter`, `arrange`, `summarize`, `group_by`\n-   Develop an understanding what code will do conceptually without running it\n-   Develop working knowledge of working with dates and `lubridate` functions\n\n<br>\n\n**Reshaping Data**\n\n-   Understand the difference between wide and long data format and distinguish the case (unit of observation) for a given data set\n-   Be able to use `pivot_wider` and `pivot_longer` in the `tidyr` package\n\n<br>\n\n**Joining Data**\n\n-   Understand the concept of variables that uniquely identify rows or cases\n-   Understand the different types of joins, different ways of combining two data frames together\n-   Be able to use mutating joins: `left_join`, `inner_join` and `full_join` in the `dplyr` package\n-   Be able to use filtering joins: `semi_join`, `anti_join` in the `dplyr` package\n\n<br>\n\n**Working with Character Data as Factors**\n\n-   Understand the difference between a variable stored as a `character` vs. a `factor`\n-   Be able to convert a `character` variable to a `factor`\n-   Be able to manipulate the order and values of a factor with the `forcats` package to improve summaries and visualizations.\n\n<br>\n\n**Working with Character Data as Strings**\n\n-   Be able to work with strings of text data\n-   Use regular expressions to search and replace, detect patterns, locate patterns, extract patterns, and separate text with the `stringr` package.\n\n<br>\n\n### Starting a Data Project {.unnumbered}\n\n*The learning goals may be adjusted before we start the material of this section.*\n\n**Data Import**\n\n-   Find existing data sets\n-   Save data sets locally\n-   Load data into RStudio\n-   Do some preliminary data checking and cleaning steps before further wrangling / visualization:\n    -   Make sure variables are properly formatted\n    -   Deal with missing values\n\n<br>\n\n**Exploratory Data Analysis**\n\n-   Understand the first steps that should be taken when you encounter a new data set\n-   Develop comfort in knowing how to explore data to understand it\n-   Develop comfort in formulating research questions\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"learning-goals.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
